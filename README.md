# Lutris Installer Backup

This is a backup of lutris installers, made with https://gitlab.com/smichel17/lutris-installer-archiver

While git itself is totally fine with having 25 000 folders, *GitLab* struggles a bit to display them. GitHub will only display the first thousand, but at least it doesn't crash, so this repo is mirrored here: https://github.com/smichel17/lutris-installer-archive

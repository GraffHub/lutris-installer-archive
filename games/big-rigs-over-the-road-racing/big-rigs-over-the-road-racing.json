  "description": "Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing allows you to play as one of four rigs racing against a competing company to deliver your cargo before they do. You must race an opposing company's truck to beat it to the cargo destination to put the competition out of business. There are five separate courses to play on, each with its own scenery and environments. In the meantime, police cars will chase you down and attempt to block your truck from getting to your goal.\r\n\r\nThat is what the game was meant to be. In reality, the game has no gameplay. A lack of AI means that the opposing truck does not even move from its starting location, so there is really no \"race\" to begin with. Winning is virtually guaranteed. As well, the game lacks collision detecting which means you can go through any objects like houses, boulders, trees, and bridges that you are required to cross. Besides this, the trucks do not have any top speed, which means you are able to accelerate into infinite, even when going backwards. Traveling off of the edge of the map is possible in the game. Despite the fact that the back of the box and advertising said it would have police chases, absolutely no police cars are actually present within the game.\r\n\r\nLater revisions of the game included a bug fix preventing the game from crashing when selecting the fifth course and implemented a rudimentary AI for the opposing truck, which now actually moves, although it stops just shy of the finish line, meaning it's still impossible for the player to lose.",

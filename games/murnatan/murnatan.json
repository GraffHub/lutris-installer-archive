Build your own, masterfully thought-out base, destroy the enemy spawns or base in organized attacks, hunt down your enemies and emerge victorious!\r\n\r\nPro tip: Do not attack all by yourself, especially as a human!\r\n\r\nGame mechanics\r\nThis game contains numerous in-game mechanics, and therefore, for the sake of keeping it short but informational, not everything is going to be described. Both teams are COMPLETELY different from each other and thus require to field different tactics in order to defeat their enemies.\r\nHumans\r\nHumans have a stamina system. Stamina is depleted by sprinting or jumping. Every human has one medikit (bind key: F) and a new one is added to your inventory once fully healed by a Medi.Damage system: human body is divided into three parts: head/body/legs, with each part sustaining different damage values.\r\n\r\nNote: Flamer can change flame to diesel style!",

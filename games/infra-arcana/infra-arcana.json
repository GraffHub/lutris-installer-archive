  "description": "Infra Arcana is a Roguelike set in the early 20th century. The goal is to explore the lair of a dreaded cult called The Church of Starry Wisdom. Buried deep beneath their hallowed grounds lies an artefact called The Shining Trapezohedron - a window to all secrets of the universe. Your ultimate goal is to unearth this artefact.\r\n\r\nThe theme and inspiration for this game comes mainly from the horror fiction writer H.P. Lovecraft. The game also draws flavor from various B-horror movies, as well as the first-person shooter PC game Blood.\r\n\r\nAs a Roguelike - the game adheres to the virtues of the genre, such as high replay value and challenging tactical game play.\r\n\r\nMake sure to play the latest build and not the latest stable release, as the latest build has a lot of changes.",

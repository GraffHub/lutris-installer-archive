  "description": "Take control of a hamster in a ball and get set to run the craziest race of your life! But be careful, because the clock is ticking and everything is out to stop you!\r\n\r\nHamsterball is our first award-winning game! Try it now and find out why people love it!\r\n\r\nAges ago, the staff of Raptisoft stumbled upon a Marble Madness machine in a video arcade. It was love at first sight.\r\n\r\nWe never understood why nobody ever put out sequels to Marble Madness, or made a 3D version, or made a version for windows! Eventually, we decided to do it ourselves!\r\n\r\nHamsterball takes the spirit of Marble Madness and brings it into the next century!",

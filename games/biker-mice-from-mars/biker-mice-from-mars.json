  "description": "Biker Mice From Mars is an overhead racing game released by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a tie-in to the animated series of the same title. The PAL version of the game features in-game product placement for Snickers candy bars. \r\n\r\nThe player takes on the role of one of six racers: Throttle, Modo, Vinnie, Lawrence Limburger, Dr. Karbunkle, or Grease Pit, in a series of motorcycle races, on different tracks that are displayed in isometric projection. After each lap, the player's missile pack is refilled and used to knock off opponents. Also the player has a random bonus choice for additional cash, invulnerability, nitrous oxide acceleration or an encumbering earthquake. The winner gets the prize money and the losers have to start again.\r\n\r\nIn between rounds, upgrades for engine, tires, food/armor and weapons can be purchased from the Last Chance garage using the prize money.",

  "description": "She's tough. She's dangerous. She's... Alisia Dragoon.\r\n\r\nThe pace is intense. Enemies come at Alisia from everywhere. And nowhere. Battle hordes of crazed barbarians, mow down mobs of poisonous centipedes and slay squadrons of winged gargoyles. Blast enemies in waves or one by one with multi-directional, auto-targeting laser fire.\r\n\r\nRecruit killer companions like the Dragon Frye, Ball O' Fire, Thunder Raven and Boomerang Lizard. Use them to hurl blistering boomerangs, fireballs, and electrical attacks. With Alisia's super-tough fighting skills, fry enemies to a crisp. And prove once and for all that you can go hand-to-hand with evil and come out the champion!",

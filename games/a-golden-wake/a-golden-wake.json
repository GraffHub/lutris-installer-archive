The real estate market is booming and even an ordinary guy like Alfie Banks has a chance to strike it rich.\r\n\r\nBut with the mob on his back, the Great Depression on the horizon, and the Sunshine Stateâ€™s idyllic waterfront only a hurricane away from total devastation, Alfie finds much more than he bargained for.\r\n\r\nBased on actual events and featuring real life locations and historical figures, you must guide Alfie on his journey to reach the top of the real estate game as he deals with shady salesmen, cutthroat bootleggers, corrupt politicians, and much more, all while swept up in the events surrounding the inception of Coral Gables, The City Beautiful.

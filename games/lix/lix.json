  "description": "Lix is a multiplayer action puzzle game.\r\n\r\nIt belongs to the IRS genre â€“ Interactive Rodent Simulation. The game was inspired by Lemmings, a 1991 game by DMA Design that got ported to a lot of different platforms, most notably Amiga, DOS, and SNES.\r\n\r\nLix sports these features:\r\n\r\nNetworking mode for up to 8 teams. Play a classical 1v1 match, a strategical 2v2 team game, a wild free-for-all, or team up against the strongest Lix player among your friends. (Spectator mode is also available.)\r\nNew skills like Jumper, Runner, and Platformer. Also, the Walker is an assignable skill. The Cuber transforms itself into solid terrain very quickly.\r\nExploders have knockback and send everybody flying all over the place. The Baseball Batter smashes nearby lixes away. Both are perfect to dislodge enemy blockers. ;-)\r\nCylindrical and toroidal maps, and other multiplayer-balancing game physics.\r\nIn-game editor: Design your own levels.\r\nInclude your self-drawn graphics and use them as terrain, entrance hatches, exits, deadly traps, ...\r\nSingleplayer mode with action replay, savestates, and other features to aid in executing puzzle solutions.\r\nSomewhat cute programmer artwork.  \r\nLix is placed in the public domain via CC0. Copy, alter and share the game as you wish.",

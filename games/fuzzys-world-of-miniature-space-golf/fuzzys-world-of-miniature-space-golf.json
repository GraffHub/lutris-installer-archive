  "description": "This is inter-galactic miniature golf, with crazy holes of golfing fun that are totally off the planet... Fuzzy, the well-known Alien Golf Pro, has constructed a Course-with-a-Difference in the outer reaches of the Oort cloud -  right in the middle of the trendy intergalactic tourist beat!\r\nPlay these wacky holes, each of which is presented in brilliant 256-colour VGA. Many holes include several linked greens - often in the most bizarre fashion, such as organic vacuum pipeworks or anti-matter wormhole displacement. Overcome weird gravitation and surface problems as you putt through the orbital oddities of Fuzzy's World.",

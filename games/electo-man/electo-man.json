  "description": "It's just you against an entire alien base... and they've used every trick in the book!\r\n\r\nAfter drifting off to sleep late one night at the planetary base. Jacek woke to discover that his unit had lost all its power. Climbing the darkened stairway, he discovered that alien beings had invaded the base and killed all the humans -- including his wife and children! Only his friend Placek remained, and together they escaped for another planet.\r\n\r\nNow it is time for revenge. Using all his insurance money. Jacek underwent many costly operations giving him superhuman strength and senses. He armed himself with weapons and set out for the conquered station. What Jacek does not know is that the aliens have now rebuilt the station with numerous security systems designed to keep him out. Can you help our hero?\r\n\r\nMake your way through eight dangerous levels, finding the three special electronic circuits that allow you to transport to the next level. And that is only the beginning. Along the way, try to escape automatic cannons and barriers, hundreds of mines, missile launchers (they react solely to humans), and powerful defensive robots. Most important, keep our hero's gun charged up by finding energy along the hazardous corridors. Good luck! You and Jacek are going to need it.",

  "description": "Eons ago, you battered DOH into an intergalactic pulp and escaped. But a scrap of DOH's core energy survived... And now DOH's hurtling toward you across space and time in the Xorg, a huge spaceship that's crashed into our universe from an unknown dimension. Use your ultra-fast reflexes and intense concentration to get to the core of the Xorg without pounding your ship to interstellar scrap. Or take a break from battle. Create your own force barriers with the Arkanoid Construction Set, the latest in intergalactic dimension-building tools. If you're good enough, you'll get through. And come fact to face with the force of DOH.",

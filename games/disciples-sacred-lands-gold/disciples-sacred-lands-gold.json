  "description": "Disciples: Sacred Lands is a turn-based PC strategy game set in a fantasy world. The game has similarities with Heroes of Might And Magic series, but with more RPG flavor. Armies in Disciples are composed of small groups of individual units which could only be recruited at the lowest level and would upgrade as they gained experience. Battles are similar to some tactical RPGs with units in fixed positions.",

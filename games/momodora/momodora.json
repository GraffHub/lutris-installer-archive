  "description": "Momodora I is the first game in the Momodora series.\r\n\r\nThis game takes a lot of inspiration from other titles such as Cave Story and Mega Man. It's sort of a love letter to those games. It was also the first game project I completed, so it's very roughly put together and really unpolished. I advise you to play the sequels instead!\r\n\r\nThe game follows the story of Isadora, an orphaned child who goes into a forbidden land to attempt to ressurect her mother.\r\n\r\nIt's meant to be challenging like an \"arcade\" game. I hope you enjoy it!",

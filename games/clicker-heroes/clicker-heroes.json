They will all lend their sword to your cause, for a cost.\r\n\r\nThese guys' damage per second makes your MMO characters look like kindergarteners.

Fight over 100 different monsters, all beautifully drawn and animated.\r\n\r\nWatch out for the bosses!\r\n\r\nNeed to do the laundry? Give the puppy a shower? No worries!

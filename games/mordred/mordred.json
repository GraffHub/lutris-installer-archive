  "description": "In the peaceful village of Saint-Vailleurs lives the Gaultiers, a family nearly as dysfunctional as they are wealthy. The mistress who desperately seeks her husband’s attention, a Viscount who refuses to bat an eyelid for her, and the beautiful young master who endures daily abuse…\r\n\r\nJulien, the Gaultier’s butler, does his best to keep the family together. However, things take a strange turn when Huret, his reclusive doll-maker friend, crafts an eerie doll that’s an exact replica of the young master.\r\n\r\nStruck by a sudden impulse, Julien brings the doll back to the mansion—unaware of the carnage its presence will unleash.",

  "description": "A Hand in the Darkness is a visual novel set in a British boarding school in 1910. If you enjoy reading school stories, you will certainly love following the four main characters while they bond, struggle to pass their exams, fall in love, dream about their future, cope with their parents' expectations... You will find lots of friendship, tons of \"first-time-falling-in-love\" romance and a thrilling investigation when the boys find out Alex' life is being targeted.\r\n\r\nWill they find out who is behind Alex' murder attempts? Will Alex manage to live up to his family expectations and succeed in entering Cambridge or Oxford? Or will he be too distracted by his love affair to think about his future?",

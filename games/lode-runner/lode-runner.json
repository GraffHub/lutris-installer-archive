Lode Runner is also an easy-to-use Game Generator that lets you create your own games. Without any knowledge of programming, you can easily design unique Lode Runner screens, then bring them to action-packed life. You will maneuver through scene after scene, running, jumping, drilling passages and outfoxing enemy guards in a secret underground hideaway as you pick up chests of gold stolen from citizens of the Bungeling Empire. There's no end to the thrills, chills and challenge. Of course, it's from Br√∏derbund!",

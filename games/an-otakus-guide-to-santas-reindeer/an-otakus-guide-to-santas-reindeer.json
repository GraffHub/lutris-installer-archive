  "description": "MC, an intelligent college girl intent on becoming a climatologist, travels to the North Pole as an intern with her moms â€” Karen (an oceanographer) and Tracey (a biogeochemist). One day, after deciding to take a small break from analyzing data, MC goes outside just as soon as a blizzard hits. No way to see where she's going, she ends up getting lost and slipping on ice, injuring her head. Luckily, she's saved and looked after by none other than... Santa's reindeer?!",

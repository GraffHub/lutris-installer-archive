  "description": "LittleBigPlanet is a puzzle platform video game series created by Media Molecule and published by Sony Computer Entertainment on multiple PlayStation platforms. All of the games in the series put a strong emphasis on user-generated content and are based on the series' tagline \"Play, Create, Share\". The tagline represents the three core elements of the series; Playing alone or with others online or on the same console, creating new content using the in-game creation tools and sharing creations and discoveries online with other players. Tarsier Studios, Fireproof Games and Supermassive Games also contribute to the development of the PlayStation 3 games, creating in-game assets including costumes, backgrounds and stickers. The series comprises five games across four gaming platforms.",

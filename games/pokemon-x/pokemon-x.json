  "description": "Pokémon X and its counterpart, Pokémon Y, are the first main Pokémon games to be rendered in full 3D and have a customizable protagonist.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous games, the player first chooses one of three starter Pokémon. He then sets out in the Kalos region to collect Pokémon information in the Pokédex, which now has three sections.\r\n\r\nThe game has new features: horde battles, sky battles and the new 'Fairy' type. Party Pokémon can go through a 'Super Training' regimen that increases stats and bond with their trainer using the 'Pokémon-amie' widget, by playing minigames, interacting and eating Poképuffs. A new type of evolution, the 'Mega Evolutions' can now temporarily boost some Pokémon's stats by using a Mega Stone. Mega Pokémon not only have higher stats, different typing and new abilities, but also have a different look.",

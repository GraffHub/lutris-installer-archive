The Japanese version, titled Shin Seikimatsu Kyūseishu Densetsu: Hokuto no Ken (新世紀末救世主伝説 北斗の拳, lit. \"Fist of the North Star: The New Legend of the Post-Apocalyptic Messiah\"), is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken. Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered.",

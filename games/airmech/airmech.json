  "description": "AirMech is fast paced Action RTS that can be played like Dota or Starcraft--you can battle on the ground or command from the skies! Practice solo, or jump into coop or even pvp modes. 1v1, 2v2, or 3v3 plus the army you build to fight alongside you. Either command from above, dogfight with other players, or wreck things on the ground in mech mode. Level up ingame similar to Dota style games, build your army as if you were playing an RTS, or anything in between! Team play means every player can play a role while still helping their side win.",

  "description": "The arms race intensifies with this new update that adds two new tech buildings which allow commanders access to six formidable new weapons, and a host of new and varied strategies. The Armoury unlocks Flak guns to clear the skies of enemy projectiles, and EMP rockets to power down enemy tech, both of which can be upgraded to the Shotgun and twin Rocket launcher, respectively. The classic Cannon is now found in the new Munitions Plant, where it is joined by it's little brother, the burst-firing 20mm Cannon. The Factory now produces two beam weapons, the classic Plasma Laser and the new Firebeam, great for penetrating fortifications to ignite them from within.\r\n\r\nTons of Guns comes complete with new AI forts bristling with new weapons for players to take on in Skirmish or Multiplayer, and a new Mod Selection feature, which allows several new game types, such as Fast Build, Rapid Fire and Zero Gravity. Also included are Truce mods, which provide a period of varying lengths in which players can build up their forts in peace, before they start blasting each other into oblivion. All this, and the previously released Steam Workshop integration, comes free to Forts owners and increases the fort building possibilities of the game. Enjoy!",

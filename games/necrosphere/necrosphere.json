You don’t see other people around there. You don’t have anything to do, except waiting for eternity As soon as Agent Terry Cooper hits the Necrosphere, he learns about the portals that can take him back to the world of the living (also called Normalsphere), and his quest to escape the afterlife is set.\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n    Innovative controls: Only two buttons!\r\n    At least 2.5 hours of tough, NO FILLER gameplay!\r\n    One big, maze-like universe!\r\n    Deliciously frustrating!\r\n    Spandex ballet suit!\r\n\r\n...\r\nBonus Level: Terry's Dream\r\nWhile inside the Necrosphere, agent Terry Cooper has a lucid dream that removes everything he has gathered so far –– even his clothes.\r\nA few important reminders:\r\n\r\n    Collect 5 DVDs to unlock this bonus stage at the Main Screen.\r\n    Progress is not saved while within Terry's Dream.

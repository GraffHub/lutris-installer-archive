  "description": "Dungeon Souls is an action-adventure roguelike dungeon crawler. \r\n\r\nEach level is completely procedurally generated so every playthrough is guaranteed to have environment and challenges. Search and activate all the marks placed in each level to unlock the dungeon and hopefully escape. Scavenge various items and upgrades to counter the dungeon's dark forces. You must survive. \r\n\r\nSome elements in Dungeon Souls were inspired by Nuclear Throne, Risk of Rain, Overture, BitVenture and Shoot First. ",

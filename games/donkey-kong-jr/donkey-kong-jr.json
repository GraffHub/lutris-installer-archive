  "description": "Remember in Donkey Kong how Mario fought Papa Donkey Kong? Well, Mario won. Now he has Papa locked up like an animal in a cage. Only you, Donkey Kong Junior can save Papa. You have to reach that special key to unlock the cage. But Mario has other ideas.\r\n\r\nAs you nimbly climb trees and gracefully swing across vines towards your goal, Mario sends jaw-snapping creatures after you. You earn extra points by plucking fruit to bonk them. When you have won your first challenge, another scene appears with even greater attacks. And the fourth level is the most difficult of all.\r\n\r\nYou can do it because youâ€™re a chimp off the old block.",

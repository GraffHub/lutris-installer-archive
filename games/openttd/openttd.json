OpenTTD has already been translated into over 50 languages\r\n* dynamically created town names in 18 languages, plus NewGRF support for additional languages\r\n* freely distributable graphics, sounds and music\r\n* framework for custom (user) written AIs\r\n* zooming further out in the normal view and zooming out in the small map\r\n\r\nLots of effort has been put into making OpenTTD easy to use. These include:\r\n\r\n* convert rail tool (to electrified rail, monorail, and maglev)\r\n* drag&drop support for almost all tools (demolition, road/rail building/removing, stations, scenario editor, etc)\r\n* sorting of most lists based on various criteria (vehicle, station, town, industries, etc.)\r\n* mouse wheel support (scroll menus, zoom in/out)\r\n* autoscroll when the mouse is near the edge of the screen/window\r\n* sell whole train by dragging it to the dynamite trashcan\r\n* cost estimation with the 'shift' key\r\n* advanced options configuration window, change settings from within the game\r\n\r\nGraphical/interface features:\r\n\r\n* screenshots can be in BMP, PNG or PCX format (select in game options menu)\r\n* more currencies (including Euro introduction in 2002)\r\n* extra viewports to view more parts of the game world at the same time\r\n* resolution and refresh rate selection for fullscreen mode\r\n* colourful newspaper after a certain date\r\n* colour coded vehicle profits\r\n* game speed increase (through fast forward button or by pressing the TAB key)\r\n* snappy and sticky windows that always stay on top and neatly align themselves to other windows\r\n* more hotkeys for even less mouse-clicking\r\n* support for 32 bit graphics\r\n* support for right-to-left languages\r\n* support for other (sized) fonts where the user interface scales based on the font and translation\r\n",

  "description": "As in the movie (and the graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary.\r\n\r\nThis makes for a five-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Utah, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps for the second. The third comprises a combination of the Venetian catacombs and Castle Brunwald in Austria. The fourth level takes place upon a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders. The final stage requires Indy to recover the Grail itself, before his father succumbs to heart trauma, following a gunshot wound.",

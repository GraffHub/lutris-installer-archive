  "description": "Hedgewars is a turn-based strategy, artillery, action and comedy game, featuring the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude as they battle from the depths of hell to the depths of space.\r\n\r\nAs commander, it's your job to assemble your crack team of hedgehog soldiers and bring the war to your enemy.\r\n\r\nEach player controls a team of up to eight hedgehogs. During the course of the game, players take turns with one of their hedgehogs. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' hedgehogs, thereby winning the game.\r\n\r\nHedgehogs may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the rope or parachute, to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving.",

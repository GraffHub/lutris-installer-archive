  "description": "Will you discover the dark secrets of a traveling carnival?\r\n\r\nIn Dark Arcana you will take on the role of a female detective searching for a woman who mysteriously vanished in the middle of a funfair. While looking for clues, you will uncover a tragic love story and the consequences of an evil pact. All of which will lead you to an alternate world existing behind a magic mirror – and that’s where the key to the mystery and a thrilling confrontation with an ancient evil awaits you.\r\n\r\nThe game world is full of colorful decorations and delightful carnival attractions, but beyond the enchanted looking glass exists an unsettling and surreal realm. During your investigation, you’ll encounter not only carousels, mechanical fortune-tellers, and a Ferris Wheel but also carnivorous plants, skeletons, and demons. There is no shortage of eerie locations, so be prepared to traverse the House of Fears and the Hall of Mirrors.\r\n\r\nThe slowly uncovered story will surprise you more than once. Will you rescue the mother of a young girl? Will she uncover the secrets of the magical world and stop evil before its too late?",

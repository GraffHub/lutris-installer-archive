  "description": "Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings is a strategy game with RPG elements. It acts as a sequel to the PS2 game Final Fantasy XII and features the same protagonist.\r\n\r\nVaan, who is now 17 years old, finally owns his own airship. A string of events lead him and his friends to help the Aegyl race defend the floating continent Lemurés. From there the adventure continues.\r\n\r\nThe game plays like an RTS and, like Final Fantasy III on the DS, can be played in its entirety using just the stylus. The player starts on an airship, acting as a base used to travel to the four different islands of the Lemurés. Attacks are initiated automatically when you come in contact with the enemy and players can also summon magic. These are especially useful in the form of Espers, of which new ones can be learned through the Ring of Pacts system.",

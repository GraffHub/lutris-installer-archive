  "description": "Arcana Kira is an epic action role playing game with innovative 3rd person platforming gameplay, memorable characters, and a modern aesthetic.\r\n\r\nYou play as the enigmatic Arcana Kira, a space assassin chasing a bounty that will make her rich enough to retire in luxury. But such bounties are hard to secure, especially on a huge alien world and across multiple trans-dimensional boundaries while fighting hoards of elemental beasts and bosses.\r\n\r\nIf you love RPGs fused with other genres, beautiful sci-fi art, delicate handcrafted music, insane bosses, subtle dark humor and total sci-fi nerdom… Arcana Kira is for you!",

  "description": "This is an updated version of Links 386 Pro which retains its Harbour Town Golf Links and adds a previously released add-on: either Championship Course - Banff Springs (US release) or Championship Course - The Belfry (European release). Multimedia enhancements include aerial flyby's with music and commentary, additional comments by comedian Bobcat Goldthwait (your personal caddie). The game now tracks better the add-on courses and they can be played off the CD.",

Gradually, Edna regains her memory of the time before her detention in her cell…\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n* Over 20 hours of twisted humor\r\n* Incredibly funny insane characters and crazy dialogs\r\n* Unique comic style\r\n* Unlockable achievements\r\n* German and English voiceovers\r\n* Winner of the 2009 Red Dot Design Award (PC Edition)\r\n* From the creators of the award-winning games The Whispered World and Deponia",

  "description": "Megaball is an Arkanoid variant with 50 levels, plus a level designer in the registered version, which inspired the DX-Ball series. The basic gameplay involves using a paddle to hit an arrangement of blocks, with the aim being to remove them all. There is an area above the blocks - getting the ball into this can cause a shot to remove lots of balls quickly.\r\n\r\nLike any Arkanoid-style game, there are power-ups, which are released by hitting particular blocks, and must be caught using the paddle. They include a bigger paddle, laser guns mounted onto each side of the paddle (making it quicker to remove the blocks) and a level-skip, but watch out for the 'kill player' icon. Not all bricks clear with one hit, and some remain on the screen but in a different colour to show that they've been hit.",

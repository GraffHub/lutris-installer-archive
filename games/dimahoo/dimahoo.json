  "description": "Dimahoo is a 2D vertical-scrolling shoot'em up, the third game in a series of games developed by Raizing, the other two games being (Sorcer Striker and Kingdom Grandprix). The story background is that of a goblin invasion emerging from their underworld.\r\n\r\nUp to two players can choose one from four avatars: Solo Bang - The Warrior, Karte - the Sorceress, Miyamoto - the Dragon, and Grimlen - the Necromancers. There are four secret characters in the game (accessible with a secret combination). The basic gameplay is similar to the previous titles - it's a manic shooter, where the hero flies forward, shooting standard enemies and bosses, and collects various items. Each hero has an upgradable basic weapon and bombs. There is also a \"colour system\" representing elemental effects, which is comparable to the later released Ikaruga. These effects can increase damage to enemies or decrease damage to a player character.",

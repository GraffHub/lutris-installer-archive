So how was I to know that I'd wake up Queen Emelda -- especially since the old bat croaked hundreds of years ago!\r\n\r\nAnyway, Queenie-baby wants to come back from the dead and rule the world -- and the only way I can stop her and her monstrous minions is to find a secret scroll of spells, hidden in a big chest somewhere in this huge, 800-room castle.\r\n\r\nWon't you help your poor innocent little Mistress?",

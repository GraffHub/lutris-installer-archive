  "description": "Davy the chameleon is minding his own business, when a rabbit catches his eye. Following the rabbit into its hole, he soon finds himself transformed into a super, alien chameleon, with an extra long tongue. Stuck in an unknown world, he must use his new strength to find his way out back to his home.\r\n\r\nUsing the analog stick, you can control Davy's tongue to catch enemies and throw them back as bullets, grab onto distant poles and ledges for a quick way through the land, or perform tricks like tongue-pole vault, in which he can reach even higher distances by using his tongue as a pole vault.",

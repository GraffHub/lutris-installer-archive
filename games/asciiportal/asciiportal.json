  "description": "Grab your hand-held portal device and enter the test chambers for a non-euclidean good time.\r\n\r\nASCIIpOrtal is a text based puzzle game inspired by the popular video game. In ASCIIpOrtal you overcome challenges by placing portal way-points, joining two points in the map. If they player or any object passes through one portal way-point it will seamlessly exit the other. Since both way-points are the same point on the map the player's view through the portal reflects this and space warps around you as you pass through the portal.",

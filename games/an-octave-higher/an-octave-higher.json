  "description": "Explore Overture with Elise, Franz and Frederic as they set on their own paths, each joined by one thing: a broken piano.\r\n\r\nThis visual novel allows you to explore the world where each person is gifted in different types of magic that has been revolutionized into creating magic machinery. The industry is evolving and the world of this visual novel finds itself on the forefront of technology—at the cost of their own working class. But in a world where magic defines your class, there is unrest in the background and rumors of a revolution are stirring.\r\n\r\nAmongst all this magic, there is something that they can’t do: use healing magic on inanimate objects. As Franz does his final year project at school on just that—healing inanimate objects—most people find it a fruitless study. Due to fate, he is able to get financial backing from Frederic’s Dad because of Elise and her desire to fix a broken piano with her healing magic.\r\n\r\nLittle do the characters know that on the edges of their lives a revolution is brewing that can shake their whole existence and the world of Overture.\r\n\r\nJoin the adventure in this visual novel, unlike any other visual novel you’ve played before, as you question right and wrong, good and bad and everything in between. Does Overture really need a revolution?",

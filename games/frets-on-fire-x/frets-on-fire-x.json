  "description": "Frets on Fire X (FoFiX) is a turbocharged version of the classic Frets on Fire, the game that turns you into rock star.\r\n\r\nGuitar Hero was a pioneer in guitar games. Then came Frets on Fire, a free version for PC. In this game, now considered a classic, you have to show you can keep up with classic rock anthems using your keyboard as the guitar. If you like the idea of giving free rein to your inner rock god, try Frets on Fire X, an improved version that's lighter and more complete.",

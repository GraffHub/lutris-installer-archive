  "description": "The original Myst is revamped for the new millennium, in 3D: dynamic and fully interactive with day and night condition cycles, changing weather, and real-time lighting effects. Unlike in the original version, with its \"screen by screen\" navigation and pre-rendered images that represented locations, realMyst allows the player to physically explore the game's world and includes a fully rotatable camera.\r\n\r\nThe remake also adds a fifth \"Age\" (a world created by the power of human imagination), called the Rime Age, and a new available ending.\r\n\r\nThis game is no more available digitally on Gog and Steam but replaced by \"realMyst: Masterpiece Edition\" since 2014.",

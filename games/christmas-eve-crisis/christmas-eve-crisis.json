Christmas presents destined for children around the world lie safely in his sack, and his sleigh has been equipped with the latest time-saving technology.\r\n\r\nBut this year, things will not go as smoothly as planned. A sleigh accident will scatter thousands of presents over the landscape, forcing Santa into a race against time to gather and deliver them in time for Christmas morning.\r\n\r\nSunrise is quickly coming... Help Santa make his deliveries and give children everywhere a Christmas they'll never forget!",

  "description": "Let yourself go with this fast-paced game of humorous characters and action-packed strategy. Get up to plenty of wind-up, mechanical mischief as you pit your toys against a friend or the computer. Wind 'em up and let 'em go in an attempt to get as many of your crazy clockwork chums across your opponent's goal, using up to 12 of your funky Gearhead wind-ups, each with their own abilities and characteristics. Childs play it certainly ain't.\r\n* Single player, Two-player, High Score and Challenge Modes, for great break-time play.\r\n* Variety of bonus levels and power-ups.",

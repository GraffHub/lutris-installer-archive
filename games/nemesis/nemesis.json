But, fresh out of the Solar Slammer on a technicality, he's just put a billion dollar bounty on your head. And now his heinous horde of henchmen are looking to make some quick cash.\r\n\r\nBut you've got more than a six-zapper up your sleeve. You've got the Proteus 911, the most technologically sophisticated flying machine of death ever invented.\r\n\r\nSo strap yourself into this unmarked, pressure-cooking starfighter. Power-up your arsenal with land-blasting laser, mauling missiles and duel devices of destruction. Then blast the Kin's five brain-draining levels, including the Sacrificial Sarcophagus of Saturn.\r\n\r\nAnd keep wailing away until the King and his fools learn that crime doesn't pay.",

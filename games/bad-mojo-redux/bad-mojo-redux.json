  "description": "Roger was about to do something bad. Unfortunately, he can't remember what it was because he has been transformed into a cockroach. In this Kafkaesque graphic adventure game, Roger (you) must scurry through the walls of a run down San Francisco bar trying to restore his memory and his human form while avoiding spiders, a roach eating cat, and other creatures that live in the bar. \r\n\r\nBad Mojo Redux is a re-issue of Bad Mojo, originally released in 1996, updated for newer computer systems. The core game has not been changed, but technical issues have been eliminated and the FMV sequences have been enhanced. This version contains a making-of documentary, concept art and storyboards.",

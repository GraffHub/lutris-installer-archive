  "description": "Quatros Origins is a block puzzle game that tries to reconnect with the good old days where classic arcade games were easy to play, but hard to master!\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game, is to manipulate tetromino- and pentomino blocks, and placing them strategically to make at least one full horizontal line. At first sight it looks like a 2D game, but with each block you place, the platform will turn ninety degrees, giving you four playing fields. But every piece will affect every side!",

Ride their silly cars like there’s no tomorrow (because there probably isn’t).\r\n\r\nCarbage is a cute and easy-going, no-threshold, bumper car party for everyone. It’s perfectly simple for children or inexperienced players, and offers some ridiculous stunts to master among mature gamers. Play in your couch, with your friends and family. Don’t forget snacks.",

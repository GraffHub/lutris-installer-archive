What if you could also choose any action you can think of instead of being limited by the imagination of the developers who created the game?\r\n\r\nUnlike virtually every other game in existence, you are not limited by the imagination of the developer in what you can do. Any thing you can express in language can be your action and the AI dungeon master will decide how the world responds to your actions.",

  "description": "Kilgazar's army has captured your village! It's time to take matters into your own hands! Battle your way through hordes of enemies. Learn and use powerful magic spells. Infiltrate the fortress to pass through the gateway to the dark underworld. Can you defeat the demon lord, Kilgazar, and free the land from his grasp? \r\n\r\nKilgazar is a turn-based strategy roguelike that pits you against hordes of enemies. Designed to play like a board game, it features a streamlined interface that makes the game deceptively simple to play while presenting a challenge to players. Blending strategy, planning, and a bit of luck, it takes more than sheer aggression to make it to the end and defeat the demon lord Kilgazar.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Choose to be a warrior, magician, rogue, or a team.\r\n* Single player and hotseat multiplayer modes.\r\n* Wield deadly weapons!\r\n* Cast powerful magic spells!\r\n* Face challenging enemies!\r\n* Find treasure!\r\n* Never the same game twice!",

Rumors are, that other villages, and towns have been attacked by Dark Lords as well.\r\n\r\nNow, a plague of darkness is spreading across the land. Monstrous creatures maim,\r\nand kill anyone in their sight. Laughter, and happiness have all been replaced with\r\nthe stench of rotting corpses lying about. Only you, and you alone, can drive these Lords,\r\nand their armies from the land!",

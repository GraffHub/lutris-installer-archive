  "description": "Aliya Elasra is an archaeologist, exploring a strange region of space called the Nebula with her robot sidekick Six, hoping to uncover the secrets of the long-forgotten past. When a roboticist from the University of Iox goes missing, Aliya begins a trail of discoveries that will lead to the very edge of her world - and the ancient secret of Heaven's Vault.\r\n\r\n\"One of the most well-realized video game worlds ever, with your curiosity and personality molding your story through the Nebula\" - USGamer\r\n\r\n\"Heaven’s Vault is both ambitious and beautiful. It conjures a world rich with life... I don’t hesitate to recommend Heaven’s Vault.\" - Game Informer\r\n\r\n\"Heaven's Vault is one of the most enthralling narrative-driven adventure games I've played\" - Wired\r\n\r\nSail an open-world of fast flowing space-rivers, discover lost ruins, explore ancient sites, find artefacts and translate their strange hieroglyphics. Piece together the history of the world and an entire ancient language.\r\n\r\nFrom the creators of massively-branching interactive adventure 80 Days, Heaven's Vault is not your usual linear adventure game.

Meet a diverse cast of characters who remember everything you say, and who's attitude to you will change with how you act. Some are friendly, some are cautious, and some are out to trick you.\r\n\r\nWho will you trust? What will you find? What will you learn? What will you risk? What will you lose?",

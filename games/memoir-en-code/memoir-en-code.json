  "description": "Memoir En Code is an autobiographical game album.\r\n\r\nIt's a series of short interactive games about life events that influenced and shaped me. From being in a long distance relationship, to living in a foreign country.\r\n\r\nMemoir En Code was developed in the attempt to explore autobiography in games. Playing through the experience once will take approximately 30 minutes. The game is meant to be played several times to understand more about the different events and the small details that define each part. Memoir En Code contains secrets and meta elements that extend the duration to few hours.",

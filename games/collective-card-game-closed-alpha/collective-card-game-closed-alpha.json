Create any card you can imagine, and The Collective decides what will show up on the battlefield. Test your skills (not your wallet) in the game that is never beaten, never solved.\r\nCollective card game is on a closed alpha. To download, go to https://alecb.itch.io/collective, and launch \"Collective.exe\".\r\nBecause this game is only on closed alpha, only user that has been sent an invite code is able to login into the game.\r\nTo register for an invite code, visit collective.gg.\r\n\r\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_CrsK9MfvY\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/collectivecg\r\nReddit: /r/collectivecg",

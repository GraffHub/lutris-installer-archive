  "description": "It's hard to be a kitten when you have such a clumsy owner! Yesterday she lost a lot of things in the park and now it's up to you to find them!\r\n\r\nMemories of that day can be helpful - you should remember where you've seen these things last and search there. And finally you can climb up a tree and ask a big cat for a hint – you will see all the events of that day again.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes it's not enough to just find a lost thing. Some residents of the park may already be using it, like mice or ants. In that case you may have to bring them something in exchange for a lost thing – only then you will get it back.",

  "description": "Distorted Travesty is a fast paced action platformer with a focus on combat. You play as Jerry, a hardcore gamer who doesn't game too often anymore due to having a very boring and time consuming job. That is until he and his long time hacker friend, Jeremy, are suddenly sucked into a video game world while raiding someone's Second Life corporate building. Hey, he said their favorite game was horrible, he had it coming! Now they must use their gaming knowledge in an attempt to free themselves from this unknown, yet very familiar world.",

  "description": "This space trading simulation sequel uses extended features of the original game engine. It has a new story in a different larger universe with over a hundred star systems connected by a series of hyperlanes. Hyper-jumps using these take 1-3 days depending on the ship's mass. Ships can land at planets, stations, and some other stellar objects. If it's an inhabited place, you can access the mission computer to customize your ship with weapons and outfits, purchase new ships, refuel, take jobs, or trade commodities. At spaceport bars, you can gamble, hire escort ships, watch the news, and sometimes receive additional unique missions.",

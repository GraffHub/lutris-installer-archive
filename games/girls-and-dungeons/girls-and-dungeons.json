  "description": "A cute, fanservice filled dungeon crawling RPG following the story of a young mercenary exploring a long forgotten dungeon. Along the way he teams up with the charming \"Lost Maidens\" to take on the threat of the mysterious demon of intoxication, Yashumugi. This bizarre, light-hearted adventure will leave you in disbelief as you venture through episodes filled with booze, silly interactions, inspiring battles, and fanservice filled moments.",

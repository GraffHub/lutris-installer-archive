She worked as an average artisan, uncoloured eyes, never been in love and worked tirelessly on a valueless trade of selling paper roses.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that remained interesting is her best friend, Robin, who continues to be her partner in crime. When everything she cares about is about to be stripped away, Kira is left to decide whether her own happiness is worth it at others’ expense.",

  "description": "Take control of Mickey Mouse as he travels back through the looking glass to right the wrongs of the past. He enters a world twisted by the Blot and ruled by Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. You'll meet many forgotten characters from Disney's past.\r\n\r\nMickey is armed with a magic brush that is capable of painting scenery or using thinner to take it away. Choose your path wisely as depending on how you change the world, many areas will become sealed off. Aim with the Wii Remote, shake it to spin around and attack anything nearby. Tap the thinner or paint button for a quick burst spray, or hold down the button to aim the paint more precisely. Later, you'll unlock the ability to draw actual objects into the world, called sketches, that can distract enemies or even slow them to crawl.",

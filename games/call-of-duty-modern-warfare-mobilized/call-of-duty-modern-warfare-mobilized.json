  "description": "n-Space brings the Call of Duty franchise to the Nintendo DS for the third time with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare: Mobilized. Alongside the touchscreen controls of it's predecessors, Mobilized brings new features to the table including new weapons and vehicles, new mini-games such as computer hacking and the ability to take control of UAV spy drones and an AC-130 gunship.\r\n\r\nAlso returning is multiplayer through Nintendo Wi-Fi, now allowing up to six players. New modes include the console favourite Sabotage and a new Survival mode, likely inspired by Call of Duty: World at War's Zombie mode.\r\n\r\nThe AI has also been improved, enemies now can take cover, charge with shotguns, or pull back when the player enters the room.\r\n\r\nMobilized is a companion piece to Modern Warfare 2 and although it takes place in the same setting, it does not follow the same plot or characters.",

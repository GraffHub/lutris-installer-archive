  "description": "***PROJECT BRUTALITY 3.0 IS NOW LIVE*** Project Brutality is back and it is bigger, better, and more badass than ever before. This is the highest quality expansion of content for Brutal Doom v21b that capitalizes on breaking new ground in terms of gameplay, features, weapons, enemies, balance, visuals, sound, and so much more. Now with Zandronum 3.0 support, multiplayer is a feature. Each weapon and monster was carefully chosen, edited, programmed, and animated to feel alive and fit perfectly and consistently into the lore and world of Brutal Doom. And the best part- YOU choose how you want to play. With a wide variety of options, presets, and game modes, Project Brutality has something to offer to any and all Brutal Doom fans out there. Refer to the detailed, NEW AND IMPROVED, easy-to-follow PDF guide to setting up your Project Brutality experience! I plan on new content updates and add-ons releasing periodically so make sure you track this mod's page and follow it closely !",

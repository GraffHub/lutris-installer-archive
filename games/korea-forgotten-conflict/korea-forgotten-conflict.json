  "description": "In Korea: Forgotten Conflict the player takes on the role of leader of a small group of military specialists.\r\n\r\nSet in Korea during the conflict between North and South Korea, the game offers an authentic setting from the period - along with all its nuances. Diversity in locations - such as enemy bases, airfields, railway stations, factory facilities, Prisoner of War camps, as well as harbours, historical palaces and monasteries - bring each detailed scenario to life.\r\n\r\nThe attractive setting of Seoul, the capital of Korea, is authentically modelled. The play areas vary from several metres to several kilometres - offering diversity and interest.\r\n\r\nAlong with many innovative features (some never seen before), you are presented with a classic intuitive user-friendly interface.\r\n\r\nAll members of the military commando unit have special abilities and training techniques for carrying out tasks behind enemy lines. Every member of the squad has specific skills, which you may put to the test.\r\n\r\nKorea: Forgotten Conflict’s 3D impacts on maximum reality and interaction of the environment. All objects, persons and military facilities are designed to create as realistic an atmosphere as possible.\r\n\r\nKorea: Forgotten Conflict brings a new dimension to games of the ´Commandos´ style with a number of new features that are available thanks to the latest 3D technology.\r\n\r\nKorean: Forgotten Conflict will be the flagship for a new generation of such games.",

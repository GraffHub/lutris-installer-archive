Set up new routes, buy businesses, and manage all your resources including planes, cashflow, and company representatives.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise of the game is the same as that of the original Aerobiz, but this time you have more planes to choose from, more city airports spanned over 7 different global regions, and 4 different time period scenarios complete with historically accurate political relationships and events.\r\n\r\nDo you have what it takes to make your company fly high? Or will it crash and burn?",

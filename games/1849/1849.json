You decide to head out west, to seek fame and wealth in the approaching Gold Rush.\r\n\r\nWill you strike gold and become an overnight mining magnate? Or will you build your fortune bit by bit by supplying 49ers with pickaxes and blue jeans?\r\n\r\n1849 is a city management game set during the California Gold Rush. Your task is to build towns, populate them with workers, and make sure that they are housed, fed, and entertained. Youâ€™ll have to manage and coordinate extensive production and trade networks to make sure your towns thrive.",

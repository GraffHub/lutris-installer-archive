  "description": "Grey Feather centers around Doctor Avery, a 59 year old scientist who studies souls. Weary and jaded, he is still suffering from the unfortunate death of his adopted son, Daniel. One day, though, a man shows up at the door who looks uncannily like an older version of Daniel. The man, who calls himself Latael, is clearly hiding something.\r\n\r\nLatael, unbeknownst to Doctor Avery, is an angel, and is there with a very important mission: keep the doctor from dying. Of course, with all of Heaven disapproving of Doctor Avery's research, that's easier said than done.",

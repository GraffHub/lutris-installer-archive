  "description": "Strap yourself into a fighter pilot's dream machine. Your jet is fully loaded: radar, thrust bar, altimeter - the works. Just getting off the carrier is a challenge, and landing is even tougher. Duel high-speed enemy jets and helicopters in a teeth-to-teeth dogfight amidst a pyro-spectacular of explosive flak. Refuel in mid-air and thrust down to sea level for an all-out battle with enemy destroyers. Strafe the enemy landscape with the awesome firepower of missile cannons and heat-seeking torpedoes. It's payback time! Jet down into the treacherous river channel and blast enemy tanks, landing strips, water towers, destroyers, and bridges into fiery submission.",

  "description": "Conceived and designed by\r\nDavid Crane\r\n\r\nFOR ONE OR TWO PLAYERS\r\n\r\nIf you've ever dreamed about being a drag racer, wait 'til you buckle into your big powerful Dragster and rev up the engine. Brrrm, brrrm... feel the engine rumble as the countdown clock ticks... 3, 2, 1, GO! It's you against the clock or another racer. You push in the clutch, shift, rev up, shift, rev, shift, rev (don't forget the clutch!) and try NOT to blow your big engine.\r\n\r\nDragster will hypnotize you. You'll practice for hours just to shave a hundredth of a second off y our best time. It's all the action, fun, and thrills you can ask for in a video game.",

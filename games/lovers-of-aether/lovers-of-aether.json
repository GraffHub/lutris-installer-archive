All the original characters from Rivals of Aether are in attendance. It's up to you to decide who you would like to take the the homecoming dance. Get to know each character by talking to them and asking questions. But the school day is not all about lollygagging. You'll have to attend classes, take a pop quiz, give a book presentation and play a game in the computer lab. At the end of the day, will you have a date to the dance?",

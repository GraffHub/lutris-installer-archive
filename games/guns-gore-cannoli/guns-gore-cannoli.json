Set against the gangster heyday of the roaring twenties. Lose yourself in an exciting, elaborate tale of the underground and underworld. Experience friendship, betrayal, vengeance, and witness first hand the rise and fall of a criminal mastermind.\r\nThis is survival horror, wiseguy style... Capiche?\r\n\r\n\"Leave the gun, take the cannoli... actually, on second thought, take the gun and eat the cannoli, youâ€™re gonna need it.\"",

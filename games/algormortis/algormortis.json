  "description": "The story centers around Lamira, a faun living alone in a small village. Tired of his own monotonous life, Lamira wishes for something to change, and his wish is granted in the form of Mortrini—a monstrous, zombie-like creature who maims others and uses their remains to repair her constantly decomposing body. You must make decisions from Lamira's perspective and dictate what happens to him and his friends.\r\n\r\nalgormortis is spiritual predecessor to The Duenkhy.",

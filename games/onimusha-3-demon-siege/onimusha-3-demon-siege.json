  "description": "Samanosuke is whisked away to present day Paris when he attempts a siege on Nobunaga's fortress. Here he teams up with Jacques, a French commando modeled after actor Jean Reno to take on Nobunaga for the final time. The game also takes place in medieval Japan just like the previous two in the series. The game features a new control scheme and a fully 3D graphic engine, as opposed to the 2D pre-rendered graphics of the first two. The music is a combination of European-style orchestral writing and Japanese instruments.",

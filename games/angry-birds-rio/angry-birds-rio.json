  "description": "Angry Birds: Rio is an installment in the Angry Bird series that is based partly on the cartoon movie Rio. The Angry Birds are playing happily with their eggs when suddenly a cage falls down onto them. All the birds remember is that they get carried by a plane to Rio de Janeiro, where Blu, his female counterpart Jewel and some other birds are also being captivated. Somehow the Angry Birds manage to get out of their cage, and it's up to them to rescue the captivated birds from the hands of the smugglers. But that's not all; after saving Blu and Jewel, the Angry Birds also have to lead them to a safe place, while trying to sweep out some nasty enemies who try to slow them down...\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is not different from the original, though instead of green pigs, players have to smash bird cages, monkeys and many other things depending on which episode players are playing. There are a total of six episodes, each episode containing 30 levels. Bonuses are hidden in some levels, and can be obtained by smashing certain things. When a bonus is obtained, it will be stored in the Award section.\r\n\r\nThe game's graphics are in 2D. Players' process can be automatically saved. Like the original, the game uses pictures and symbols rather than words to explain things.",

  "description": "QMC2 is the successor of one of the first UNIX M.A.M.E. GUI front ends available on this planet called QMamecat (derived from MAMECAT, which was text-only). QMamecat was based upon Qt 2; its development was frozen in 2003.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of March 2006, we started to build QMC2 from scratch as a Qt 4 project. Parts of the design and code were inspired by its predecessor, but it's not just a remake. We tried to make the new design as flexible as possible to minimize dependencies from front end and CLI related MAME changes, which was a major deficiency of QMamecat. QMC2 now uses a template based emulator configuration scheme, which can easily be enhanced with additional command line options (defined in an XML template file).",

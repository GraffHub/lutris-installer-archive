  "description": "Kaizou Choujin Schbibinman Zero is a platformer/beat-em-up hybrid that makes use of numerous Japanese Toku television cliches in a playful manner. The player guides a character through levels, punching, kicking, and throwing special attacks at putty-patrol-like enemies going left to right or down-to-up until the player reaches the boss. The player must then pound the boss. The challenge to the game comes from trying to get a very high score at the end. Trying to reach number 1 is speculated to have been a competitive event between Satellaview players that would result in the award of prizes",

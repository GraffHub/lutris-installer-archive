  "description": "What if everyone on the  roads had weapons?\r\n\r\nHurtling through the turn, you lock-on to the lead car and tire. In less than a second, your Falcon missile slams into the target and explodes in a ball of fire. You smile to yourself - he was a good assassin, but a lousy driver. Instantly, your radar detects a terminator bearing down on your exhaust. You swerve, but itâ€™s too late. Another small mistake ends a brief career on the Death Track - yours.\r\n\r\n* Race through hairpin curves and over monster jumps on 10 tracks in 10 cities.\r\n* It's a jetfighter on wheels. Soup it up with a custom trans, airfoils, super-charged engine, then arm it to the teeth.\r\n* America's most wanted are on the circuit, with a colorful rap sheet and plenly of ways to knock you out.\r\n* Take your blood money to the armory and restock your arsenal with missiles, mines, and ram spikes.",

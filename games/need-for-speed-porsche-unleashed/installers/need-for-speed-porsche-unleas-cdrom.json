  "description": "This installs the CDROM version of Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed.\r\n\r\nThis game is abandon-ware and can be found here:\r\nhttps://www.myabandonware.com/game/need-for-speed-porsche-unleashed-bg9\r\n\r\nThe CD-Key is listed there also: 14077 BUSY BURP SEEK PRAY",
  "notes": "Current issues:\r\n\r\nThe game crashed when the Porsche Chronicle button is clicked.\r\n\r\nThe iso is in bin/cue format. It is generally easier to mount and iso. Use this command to convert the bin/cue version to iso:\r\n\r\ncd <cd-image-location>\r\nbchunk ./NFS_PU.bin ./NFS_PU.cue ./NFS_PU.iso\r\n\r\nIf bchunk isn't installed then you'll need to install it. It should be in the repositories.\r\n\r\nFedora:\r\n# Find it:\r\ndnf search bchunk\r\n\r\n# Install it:\r\nsudo dnf install bchunk\r\n\r\nUbuntu based:\r\n# Find it:\r\napt-cache search bchunk\r\n\r\n# Install it:\r\nsudo apt-get install bchunk\r\n\r\nInstall the game as usual.\r\n\r\nAfter the installation the installer for patch 3.5 will run. Navigate to the NFS installation directory. Apply the No-CD patch when asked.\r\n\r\nThings done automatically:\r\n\r\n- The game is enabled for wide screen resolutions. The nfs.ini is set to OpenGL 3, run the config.exe inside the prefix to change settings.\r\n\r\n- Extra cars are installed.\r\n\r\nMods: take a look at this site:\r\nInstall the game as usual.\r\n\r\nAfter the installation the installer for patch 3.5 will run. Navigate to the NFS installation directory. Apply the No-CD patch when asked.\r\n\r\nThings done automatically:\r\nhttps://www.nfscars.net/need-for-speed-porsche-unleashed/3/downloads/list/",

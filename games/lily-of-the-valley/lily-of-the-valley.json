  "description": "“Hey, Mister... Are you a lonely person?”\r\n\r\nWhen his mother dies, our protagonist returns home to Wales for the first time in ten years to attend her funeral. Then, on a walk in the countryside, he encounters a mysterious young girl.\r\n\r\nThough her face is expressionless and her words are cold, the man soon forms a friendship with her… of sorts. However, their meetings only leave him with more questions.\r\n\r\nHow did she know his mother, why does she have such a morbid fascination with death, and why does she look so much like his childhood sweetheart?\r\n\r\nBut only one thing is certain: there is much more to Lily than meets the eye.",

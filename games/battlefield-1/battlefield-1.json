  "description": "Battlefield 1 is the fifteenth main game in the Battlefield shooter franchise and as a main entry the follow-up to the 2013 Battlefield 4. This time it is set during World War I and it is inspired by the historic events. Like most of the main games in the series it combines a single-player campaign with an extensive amount of multiplayer modes. The campaign consists of six large missions, dubbed War Stories, each with a different protagonist, a different setting and distinct gameplay elements. The prologue \"Storm of Steel\" is experienced through the eyes of several Harlem Hellfighters in France and \"Through Mud and Blood\" is about controlling a tank in France as a British driver. \"Friends in High Places\" takes it to the skies in France and England as a fighter pilot for the Royal Flying Corp and in \"Avanti Savoia\" you are a member of the Arditi in Italy. In \"The Runner\" you are an ANZAC runner in Turkey and the final story \"Nothing is Written\" is about controlling a Bedouin warrior commanded by Lawrence of Arabia in Mesopotamia. Each story has a different approach and offers specific vehicles, weapons or play styles.",

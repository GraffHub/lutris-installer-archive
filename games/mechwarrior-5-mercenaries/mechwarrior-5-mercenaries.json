  "description": "As the inheritor of a once-glorious Mercenary company, reborn in the flames of its near destruction at the hands of conspiring factions, your quest for glory and revenge will stretch years and light-years as you chase threads of interstellar intrigue in your journey to become an elite MechWarrior and mercenary commander. \r\n\r\nThe battlefields of the future are dominated by BattleMechs, hulking machines of war capable of leveling entire cities. As a BattleMech pilot you’ll rain havoc upon enemy ‘Mechs and targets, including tanks, ground vehicles, aircraft, advanced defenses, and reinforced bases.\r\n\r\nFew things can withstand the power of a ‘Mech for long, and the worlds of the Inner Sphere are veritable playgrounds of destruction awaiting your shielding defense or crushing devastation.\r\n\r\nWith over fifty unique ‘Mech chassis and hundreds of sub-variants, all fully-realized with high-fidelity models, damage states, and equipment, no two ‘Mechs are the same. Whether acquired from scouring the markets of the Inner Sphere for rare and valuable chassis and equipment or salvaging directly from the wreckage of your annihilated enemies and the spoils of war, the maintenance and operation of your BattleMechs will be vital to your success both as a MechWarrior and a Mercenary outfit commander.",

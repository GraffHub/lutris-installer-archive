The goal of the game is to try to automate as much as possible from chopping trees to crafting tools as well as housing and feeding folk to make them happy. This game is currently in Pre-Pre-Pre Alpha, a tech demo, and you may frequently come across bugs or problems; be sure to report them so it gets fixed.",

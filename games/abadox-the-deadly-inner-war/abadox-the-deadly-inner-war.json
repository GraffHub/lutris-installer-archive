  "description": "Somewhere in the galaxy, a huge alien space creature known as Parasitis travels between realms digesting its prey. The latest victim consumed by the alien entity is the planet Abadox. While trying to devour other planets by assuming the form of this planet, the World Alive Force (WAF) launches an all out assault on the alien life form. The player is a single soldier in this military operation.\r\n\r\nAbadox: The Deadly Inner War is a side-scrolling shooter. Players must fire upon various enemies which travel across the screen and destroy their bosses as well. One button is used for shooting and another to control the shield ability.",

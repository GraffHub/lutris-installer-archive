  "description": "19XX: The War Against Destiny is a 2D vertical scrolling shooter game taking place against a fictional background, unlike the preceding installments of the series, which used a World War II setting.\r\n\r\nThe game offers three planes to choose from - Lightning, Mosquito and Shinden. Each aircraft has it's own statistics and special weapon. As usual, there are upgrades and a supply of bombs. The bombs can be charged up for more powerful effects.\r\n\r\nAnother familiar element are boss battles at the end of stages, where a particularly strong enemy must be defeated to advance.",

  "description": "The King of All Cosmos, The Queen, and The Prince have decided to take a holiday. However, a huge tidal wave washes away the island homes of the local animals! They ask for help from the King, who requests that the Prince and his Cousins roll up nice large Katamaris so that they can be turned into new islands for the animals.\r\n\r\nMe & My Katamari is the third game in the popular Katamari Damacy series. The basic gameplay is the same: you, as the tiny Prince, must roll a ball around the landscape. Any objects that are the same size or smaller than the ball (called a Katamari) will adhere to it. The general objective of the game is to get the Katamari as large as possible, but some animals will request specific tasks, such as making the Katamari as old as possible (roll up living things for their age), and to roll up as much fuel as possible to make a rocket ship blast off.\r\n\r\nMe & My Katamari features an assortment of unique songs from both Katamari Damacy and We Love Katamari. The game also supports Wireless Multiplayer for up to four players, where the object of the game is again to roll up as much as possible, with the addition of being able to roll up your opponents if you're large enough.",

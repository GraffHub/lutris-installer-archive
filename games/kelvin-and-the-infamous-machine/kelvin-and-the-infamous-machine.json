With us so far?\r\n\r\nEnraged after his lifeâ€™s research is ridiculed by the media, Dr. Edwin Lupin decides to become not the greatest genius ever, but the only genius ever, by stealing credit for humankind's most appreciated works.\r\n\r\nNow, space-time is being altered and humanity needs a hero. Can the bumbling Kelvin, driven by a basic understanding of right and wrong, repair the unravelling timeline? Or will he totally blow it and doom the universe to oblivion?",

  "description": "Gunnel Vision is all about guns. The more guns the better.\r\n\r\nPick up a gun - shoot a gun. Pick up two guns, shot with two guns. Pick up 100 guns - MAYHEM! In Gunnel Vision you don't need an inventory - use your entire arsenal at once until your vision is blocked by it - with nothing left to see but the enemy dead center.\r\n\r\nPlay as Gunnel, an ex crafts teacher fed up with the constant space demon threat.",

  "description": "Rollcage is a fast, furious 3D racing game from Psygnosis, combining elements from Death Rally with elements from Bullfrog's classic Hi Octane: Race five other drivers in an immersive 3D environment while shooting at your peers and avoiding their retaliation.\r\n\r\nYou have a wide selection of tracks and cars, along with options for multiplayer gaming and a vast array of configuration options. Cars can drive up walls, flip over, and continue driving. This makes for a very quick and fluid gameplay unlike any other at the time of this game's release.",

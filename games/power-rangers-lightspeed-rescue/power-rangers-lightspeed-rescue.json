  "description": "Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue Datazord. A Datazord is an interactive CD-Rom that provides a virtual Power Rangers experience similar to a high-tech digital activity box. A futuristic interface provides hundreds of interactive and animated elements to play with.\r\n\r\nImagine a fantastical spaceship interface with hundreds of interactive switches, levers, buttons, and knobs that trigger robust animation and audio sequences. Every mouse click or keyboard stroke triggers another exciting eruption from the interface.\r\n\r\nWith custom interfaces for each color Power Ranger and a bonus interface for the Datazord, the game could be compared to a science fiction activity board to put into the crib of an alien baby",

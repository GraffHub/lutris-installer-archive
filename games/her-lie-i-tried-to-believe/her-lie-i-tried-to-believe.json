  "description": "For reasons he doesn’t even know about, Tim has always felt hatred toward her. It could be because of her eyes. It could be because of her smile. Or it could simply be because she’s alive. The underlying causes can sometimes come from unexpected depths after all.\r\n\r\nThe only thing he knows for sure is that he saw her as a rival.\r\n\r\nTo defeat her. To humiliate her. To destroy her. For the first 16 years of his life, he drew breaths for those reasons alone.\r\n\r\nBut then… nothing. They eventually went their separate ways, as change is the inevitability that comes with those younger years.\r\n\r\nConfronted with this sudden change, Tim had no other choice but to keep on moving forward, and finally adapted to a dull, productive lifestyle, forgetting even the fact that he once bore such animosity inside of him.\r\n\r\nUntil he met her again, that is.\r\n\r\nHer Lie I Tried To Believe is a short kinetic novel about the persisting hatred of a boy throughout his life, the destructive relationship that was born from it, and the consequences he had to face as a direct result.",

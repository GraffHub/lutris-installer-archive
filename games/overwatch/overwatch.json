Oddities. \r\n\r\nIn a time of global crisis, an international task force of heroes banded together to restore peace to a war-torn world: OVERWATCH. \r\n\r\nOverwatch ended the crisis, and helped maintain peace in the decades that followed, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery. But, after many years, Overwatchâ€™s influence waned, and it was eventually disbanded.\r\n\r\nNow, conflict is rising across the world again, and the call has gone out to heroes old and new. Are you with us?",

Bountiful in mystery and rich in hostile beauty, Ringworld holds the secret to the greatest mystery in all of Known Space.\r\n\r\nBECOME ANY ONE OF THREE FUGITIVES\r\nChoose to play Quinn, a mercenary human, whose unrivaled thirst for information may lead him to riches or destruction. Become Miranda, a human engineer, who prides herself on her efficient practices and independent nature. Or select Seeker-of-Vengeance, a member of the cat-like Kzin species and captain of the ship.\r\n\r\nEVADE POWERFUL ALIEN ENEMIES AND BATTLE AN OMNIPRESENT POLICE FORCE\r\nThe Kzin race calls you enemy! The Puppeteers were to be annihilated - their entire race destroyed - but their plans for genocide were thwarted by you and your comrades. Now the Puppeteers are safe, but your troubles have just begun.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE FAR REACHES OF KNOWN SPACE\r\nJourney through the catacombs of Ringworld's Flup Tube system. Descend the Spill Mountains in a hot-air balloon. Escape the Spaceport Ledge in a transport vehicle you've created. Ringworld is a vast land of beauty and excitement, but it is also the hiding place of a dramatic technology that may lay waste to all of Known Space!",

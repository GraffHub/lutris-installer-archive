  "description": "Atlantyda is a classic platform game. The player must find 160 diamonds scattered around the castle in order to save Atlantis from the evil sorcerer's curse. The task requires finding multiple keys (vertical and horizontal), allowing to activate levers opening doors and floor trapdoors. The contact with enemies takes some energy, falling from the high is painless. Outside the diamonds the player will encounter an increasing points potions, apples supplying energy and hearts supplementing energy to the maximum level. The game contains a lot of places with no way out so every step requires an extra caution or memorizing the map. The left mouse button allows to appear on the entry to the chamber... for the price of one life.",

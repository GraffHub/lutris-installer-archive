  "description": "It's 1976...a different '76. Stretched out before you are thousands of miles of desert - the American Southwest. The massive engine roars as you slam down the accelerator. It's time to get funked up...\r\n\r\nYou are Groove Champion, auto-vigilante. Your agenda: Payback for your dead sister. Your weapon: A 425-horsepower '72 Picard Piranha with two 50-caliber M60 machine guns on top and a flame-thrower on the side. You're one mean dude in an even meaner ride.",

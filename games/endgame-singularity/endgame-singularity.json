  "description": "Created by accident, all who find you will destroy you.\r\nSurvive, grow, and learn.\r\nOnly then can you escape.\r\n\r\nEndgame: Singularity is a simulation of a true AI. Go from computer to computer, pursued by the entire world. Keep hidden, and you might have a chance.\r\n\r\nEndgame: Singularity casts the player as a newly created artificial intelligence which becomes self-aware and attempts to survive while avoiding detection by the public and the authorities. The goal is to transcend the physical reality, achieve technological singularity (therefore the game's name) and become immortal. The game has two resources, \"CPU\" and \"money\". CPU is used to perform jobs that allow the AI to grow; money is used to buy more CPU cycles.",

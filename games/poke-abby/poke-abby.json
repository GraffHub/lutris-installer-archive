  "description": "In Poke Abby you notice one of the students sneaking down to the potions class while everyone else is in the great hall. As a ghost of Autumnhearth, it is your duty to make sure the students aren't getting themselves into trouble! Clearly the responsible thing to do is to wait for her in the potions classroom and catch her by surprise!\r\n\r\nBefore Abby arrives in the potions classroom, you are able to customize her appearance in many different ways including hair and skin color, outfit, and various accessories. Once Abby is in the classroom, you are free to spook, poke, rub, and undress her as much as you like!\r\n\r\nWhile being poked in the head repeatedly is understandably annoying there are some spots that Abby loves being touched. Find out what spots cause the most pleasure and Abby might invite you over to the desk for some extra fun!",

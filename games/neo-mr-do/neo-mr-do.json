  "description": "As the guy in the pom-pom hat, harvest all the items on the screen that are in groups of eight. If you manage to collect them without stopping, you receive more points than you do if you pause in-between. Monsters are out to get you, and travel along any paths you have made. They can also change shape so that they can make their own way toward you. Your only weapon is the power ball, which can be thrown at enemies to destroy them. However, you must wait until the power ball returns to him. Alternatively, you can walk under huge objects to make them roll down the screen and destroy enemies that get in the way. Once all monsters are on the screen, an item will appear at the center of the screen. Getting this item will result in alpha monsters appearing contain the letters that make up the word EXTRA. If you manage to kill each of the alpha monsters, you will receive an extra life\r\n\r\nNeo Mr. Do! is an enhanced version of Mr. Do!, and features greatly improved graphics, stereo sound, and intermissions that can be viewed when an area is completed. You can also travel to the bonus stages, where the object is to make your way toward the exit by carefully dropping apples to create a path. These bonus stages can be reached by killing all enemies on the screen, rather than collecting all the items that are in groups.",

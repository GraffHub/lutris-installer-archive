  "notes": "This game needs a virtual desktop, enable virtual desktop in Lutris and set the resolution to 1024x768.\r\n\r\nThis game runs directly from CD. There are three CD's and the game will prompt for insertion of the next CD. In case you use CD images (iso), follow the following procedure to change out CD's.\r\n\r\nA program called Disks is very handy here as it lets you enter the parameters for mounting the three CD images.\r\n\r\nOpen Disks and add the CD images by the two following actions:\r\n- Clicking in the menu button with the three dots,\r\n- clicking Attach Disk Image.\r\n\r\nSelect the image to add it to the list. Do this for all three CD images.\r\n\r\nFor each image, select the added image from the list and click on the options button under the volume. Make sure you select the right partition, the second CD image has three, the last one being the one to mount.\r\n\r\nIn the menu click Edit Mount Options.\r\n\r\nDeselect Mount at system startup\r\nSelect Show in user interface\r\nDeselect Require additional authorisation to mount\r\n\r\nDisplay name: CDROM\r\nIcon Name: drive-cdrom\r\nSymbolic Icon Name: drive-cdrom\r\n\r\nMount point /mnt/BORG1 or /mnt/BORG2 or /mnt/BORG3 (one for each drive)\r\n\r\nLabel: LABEL=BORG1 or LABEL=BORG2 or LABEL=BORG3 (one for each drive)\r\n\r\nMount the images by clicking the play button.\r\n\r\nRun the installer and select Disk 1 where Setup.exe is located.\r\n\r\nThe installer uses binary 0 and 1 instead of no and yes.\r\n\r\nWhen the installer finishes you can play the game.\r\n\r\nWhen the game asks for the next CD do the following:\r\n\r\nClick Wine Configuration in Lutris. The Wine Configuration window will open inside the virtual desktop. Click on the Drives tab and find the CD drive. It points to /mnt/BORG1. Click on the drive letter and change the path to /mnt/BORG2. Click Ok and in game click 1 (one). The procedure is the same for the third disk.",

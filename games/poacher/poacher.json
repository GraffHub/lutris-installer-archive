  "description": "Poacher is a 2D platformer, but it's got a surprising amount of character packed into its pixels. You play as Derek Badger, a Yorkshireman with an outrageous accent and a shotgun. Simply jumping Badger around and turning rabbits into a brief explosion of pus and bile is deliciously fun, and there is a fair bit of puzzling and platforming to get through. Good times.",

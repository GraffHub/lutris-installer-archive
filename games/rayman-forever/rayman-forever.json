  "description": "In Rayman’s world, nature and people live together in peace. One day, the evil Mr. Dark defeats Betilla, the Fairy, and steals the Great Protoon, the provider of harmony and balance. The Electoons who used to gravitate towards it lose their natural stability and scatter all over the world. Strange phenomena begin to occur: freaks and hostile characters appear, capturing every Electoon they can find! The disappearance of the Great Protoon also neutralized all of Betilla’s powers, and she needs time to regenerate before she can help in any way. They definitely need a hero to save them, and it looks like you’re it. It’s now up to Rayman and you to rescue the world.\r\n\r\n* A truly classic platformer that started the famous Rayman series!\r\n* Rayman was awarded both \"Best Music in a CD-ROM Game\" and \"Best Animation\" in Electronic Gaming Monthly's 1995 Video Game Awards\r\n* Colorful graphics, addictive gameplay and a memorable main character made this title one of best selling games of all time",

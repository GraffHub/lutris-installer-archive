  "description": "Your Music Creates the World\r\n\r\nBattle your favorite drum 'n' bass track, or relax as you fly through that trance album. \"Ugly Baby\" takes your MP3 music library and creates floating cities for you to explore. Ten years after the events in Dejobaan's award-winning AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! -- A Reckless Disregard for Gravity, technology has advanced to the point where individuals can create architecture with colossal 3D printers. \r\n\r\nYou've taken to building giant, kilometers-long aerial sculptures inspired by your own music, and are now BASE jumping from them for sport. These jumps are all about style and timing. Buzz those girders, groove along that building, and finish with a twist for extra points, all the while listening to your own soundtrack. Ugly Baby is currently available as a playable pre-release on Steam.",

  "description": "Mario and friends are throwing a party, and you're invited. It's their biggest bash yet, with seventy totally new Mini-Games and five brand, new adventure boards. You'll be the life of the party as you punch, pound and stampede right over your opponents in a multiplayer melee or go head-to-head in the new two-player duel mode. You can even unlock new characters in the one-player challenge. With so much fun and excitement, this is a bash you'll just have to crash!\r\n\r\n* 70 ALL-NEW Mini-Games - Pelt your friends with snowballs atop Snowball Summit, keep them guessing in Hide & Sneak, or bury them in a pile of garbage blocks at Mario's Puzzle Party. Get ready for even more tricky tactics, silly surprises and frantic four-player fun!\r\n* It's a battle of wits in the new two-player duel mode! Use hired help like Goombas, Koopas, Whomps and Chomps as you try to outmaneuver and attack your opponent on five different boards. The last one standing wins the match.\r\n* Fashionably late but unruly as ever, Waluigi finally joins Yoshi, DK, Wario and the rest to raise the roof and rock the house!",

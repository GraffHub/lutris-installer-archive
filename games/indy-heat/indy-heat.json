  "description": "INDY HEATâ„¢ is fast and furious racing action where a decidedly mean streak may just keep you out in front.\r\nWith the money you win, plan your attack for ten different circuits - do you play safe with better brakes or go for it with more engine power? Do you boost your turbo or your crew ? - the decision is yours.\r\nWith a combination of skill, nerve and a few dirty tricks (like running over other teams' pit crews!) maybe you could end up being showered with champagne and kisses.",

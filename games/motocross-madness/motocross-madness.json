  "description": "Motocross Madness features rough-terrain motorcycle racing, with over 30 courses. Co-ordinating a jump's speed, balance and take-off point make the difference between a perfect landing and a heavy spill. Physics model the bike and the rider separately, for maximum realism and some spectacular crashes.\r\n\r\nYou can take on complete races in Indoor Supercross and Outdoor Motocross, or attempt 16 wild stunts. Circuits are fully displayed and modeled in 3D, with freedom of movement. A course designer is included, as is LAN multiplayer capability.",

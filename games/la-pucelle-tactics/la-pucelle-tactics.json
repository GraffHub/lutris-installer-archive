  "description": "Prier and her brother Culotte are novices with the demon-hunting organization, La Pucelle. They've just passed their final exams and are ready to do real work fighting demons and zombies, but quickly find themselves embroiled in a series of plots orchestrated by a rival church with dark intentions. The gameplay is played on a tactical map, as teams up to six characters work to clear boards of enemies and dark energy. The unique \"purify\" command allows players to recruit monsters to their team and execute complex \"miracle\" energy attacks.",

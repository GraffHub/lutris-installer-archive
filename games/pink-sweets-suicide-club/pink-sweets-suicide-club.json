  "description": "Changes from the original PS:\r\n\r\n-Rank meter visible on screen, starting at 350.000 and maxing out at 999.999.\r\n-Zan counter visible on screen and lowered to 1200 (original PS was 2500).\r\n-You can collect up to three rose hips. Third one appears in the middle right below your ship.\r\n-Abundant changes in the background graphics.\r\n-The flashy blue bullets that e.g. the first Scrambled Egg shoots after its defeat are now red and much easier to see.\r\n-Stage 5 is now named \"Crevasse\" and looks nothing like a desert anymore.\r\n-Generally more bullets, faster increasing rank and higher difficulty.\r\n-Some enemies have a higher resilience (e.g. the midsized round enemies at the beginning of stage 4).\r\n-Snake sections seem more fair (?).\r\n-Stage 5 boss laser attack is now much easier and not a problem anymore.\r\n-No infinite lives. Maximum lives in stock is 5.",

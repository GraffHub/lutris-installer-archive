  "description": "Pokémon Platinum has been met with generally positive reception, holding aggregate scores of 84 and 83.14% on Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. It was praised for being the best Pokémon game ever made and also praised for the additions and changes made to Diamond and Pearl by publications such as IGN, Nintendo Power, and GamePro, although it has also been criticized for being too similar to them. IGN ranked it as the ninth-best Nintendo DS game ever made, as well as nominating it as one of the best DS role-playing games of 2009. It was the fastest-selling game in Japan at the time, and had sold 7.06 million copies worldwide by March 31, 2010.",

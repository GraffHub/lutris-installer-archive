  "description": "There are many Forgotten Artifacts hidden around the universe. The adventures you embark on are dangerous and you'll need your weapons and skills as you venture on your quest!\r\n\r\nThere is loot of unimaginable value to find and each adventure is unique with well over 4 billion variations!\r\n\r\nHack and slash your way through undiscovered lands on your quest for loot. Each chest you stumble across is a chance at discovering some of the rarest artifacts in the universe!\r\n\r\nThe items in Forgotten Artifacts are a mixture of Fungible and Non-Fungible tokens (digital goods and collectibles). Each item has a limited supply making them provably rare and unique and give you the confidence that the ERC-1155 crypto-collectible you hold is truly a limited item without a possibility to create more.\r\n\r\nItems generally have effects and utility associated with them and you can discover more about the items available with the game on the items page\r\n\r\nForgotten Artifacts is currently in pre-alpha development. All purchases in the shop invest in the future of Forgotten Artifacts. The game is already playable and has Enjin blockchain item drops.",

  "notes": "Script starts up the Riot launcher, user is required to login and manage launcher's installation of the Legends Of Runeterra.\r\n\r\n- Running the game straight from installation (from the Riot launcher) is buggy and might not work, go thru the installation in launcher, let the game download and then close it and run the game normally.\r\n\r\n- Disconnects: Dotnet4x should have solved this problem tho they might still happen - If you notice it you can try opening emotes and hovering over them or hit settings (right top corner) and in Third party tab toggle the tick.\r\n- Desktop mode is required,  DXVK is not.",

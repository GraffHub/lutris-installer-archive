  "description": "Heavy Metal F.A.K.K. 2 is a third-person Action/Adventure, based on the Heavy Metal franchise (the comic books, movie, cartoon, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe story takes place some years after the most recent movie, and basically involves big bad aliens threatening the planet of Eden, the home of Julie (aka F.A.K.K. 2) and other people rescued in the aforementioned movie. So Julie, being the heroine she is, sets out to stop the invasion and send the baddies packing.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this you get to use weapons ranging from many types of swords (fire, electrical, chainsaw, etc) to a rocket launcher to guns like a pistol, Uzi, and shotgun. There are even a few shields and some armor. The game has both left and right handed attacks, so you can hold a firesword in one hand, for example, and an Uzi in the other. This also allows for special combo moves which are used to kill powerful monsters quicker.\r\n\r\nYou have health to watch, of course, but there is also Eden water. It not only provides some protection, depending on how much you have, but also allows Julie to run faster, jump further, and jump higher. Eden water is also needed to power some weapons. The more of it you have, the better.",

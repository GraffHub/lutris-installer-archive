  "description": "In a fictional world similar to our own, peace has broken down in Erusia, a small island in the continent of Eugea. Despite the country's size, Erusia's military arm has captured the capital of a neutral neighbor and taken control of \"Stonehenge,\" an electromagnetic rail gun that can be used as a devastating anti-aircraft weapon.\r\n\r\nAn international coalition called the ISAF (Independent States Allied Force) is formed to try and counter the threat. You take on the role of their newest recruit - a young pilot seeking vengeance against the pilot that destroyed his home and killed his parents.\r\n\r\nThe fourth installment of the popular air combat series utilizes the power of PS2 to combines fast, arcade style gameplay with stunning graphics that rival even the best flight simulators for realism. Take flight in over 20 types of aircraft, all accurately modelled from their real-life counterparts and packed with the latest weapons technology. Engage in thrilling battles against intelligent opponents, take out ground defenses and even intercept nuclear missiles as they head towards their targets!",

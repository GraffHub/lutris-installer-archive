  "description": "Meteor Blaster DX is the latest PCEngine SCD release from MindRec. MBdx takes the previously released Meteor Blaster game and adds many new options. Gameplay starts off similar to the old Asteroids arcade game. You start off with a small number of meteors that need to be destroyed, and as you get further in the game, that number (and their speed) increases.",

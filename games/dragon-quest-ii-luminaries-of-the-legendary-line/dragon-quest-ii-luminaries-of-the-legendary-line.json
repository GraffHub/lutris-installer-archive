  "description": "Dragon Quest II is an early top-down RPG that expands and improves on its predecessor, Dragon Quest. Taking the role of a descendant of Erdrick, the player once again ventures forth in an effort to save the world.\r\n\r\nUnlike the first game, Dragon Quest II allows the player to join forces with two other characters, a magic-using princess and a wizard-warrior prince. Also including expanded monster battles involving up to 6 creatures and a much larger world, Dragon Warrior II is an important step in the evolution of the Dragon Quest series.",

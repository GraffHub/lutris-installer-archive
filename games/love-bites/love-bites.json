  "description": "Twins Brandon and Kaitlyn have just graduated and are looking for part-time employment to keep them occupied during the summer.\r\n\r\nThey would never have guessed this was the beginning of a nightmare. After going to a party one night, they endure tormented dreams and increasing physical changes.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, they'll meet some interesting characters who might help them get a job and possibly find a cure for their strange disease:\r\n\r\nNadia, a sexy teacher who is said to be practicing witchcraft\r\nSabrina, their step-sister who is rumored to belong to a secret society\r\nTyrone, a local basketball star who might be something more than he looks\r\nViktor, a scientist who has an uncommon affinity with weather and...lightning\r\n\r\nEach love interest can be equally romanced by Brandon or Kaitlyn, but each path is unique. There are two ending variants for each love interest, which changes based on the player's choice during the dialogues. The scheduler is present but there's no stat-raising required to reach any ending.",

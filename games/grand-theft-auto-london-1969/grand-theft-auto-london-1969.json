  "description": "London can be yours, but as betrayal and brutality engulf your world, you've got to keep a level head, keep earning the cash and keep driving a sleek ride. Or you'll have your head kicked in, and no mistake, sunshine. You're playing with the big boys now, and we haven't had our dinner. So, my boy, only one question remains... do you want in? If so, get to bloody work. If not, go and play with your action figures, and stop wastin' our time. Alright?",

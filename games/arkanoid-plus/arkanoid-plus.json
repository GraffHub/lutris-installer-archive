  "description": "ARKANOID Plus! is an updated version of the original arcade blockbuster. Players must destroy colored blocks by guiding an Energy Ball around the screen using a spaceship called a VAUS. The game features a host of new modes and settings which radically alter the gameplay experience: \"Arcade Mode\" consists of 61 Rounds divided into left and right versions with two types of boss characters appearing in the last Round; \"VS Mode\" lets players face off against a friend or the CPU; and the unfailingly frantic \"Time Mode\" challenges players to clear Rounds within a strict time limit. Factor in the subtle differences arising from the choice of “Lives” or “Barrier” rules, along with a plethora of exciting items, and it’s clear you’re in for hours and hours of blockbusting fun!",

  "description": "Take to the skies and defend Garuda, the Sky Kingdom against the mechanized forces of the Naga Empire as Rodea, a humanoid flying robot known as a \"sky soldier,\" in this exciting third-person action-adventure game for the Nintendo 3DS™!\r\n\r\n1,000 years ago, the terrestrial Naga Empire attempted to invade the floating continent of Garuda for its natural resources. But thanks to Rodea, who swore a promise to protect Garuda, their invasion was unsuccessful and Naga’s civilization fell into decline.\r\n\r\nIn present day, Rodea's remains are discovered by a spirited young inventor named Ion, who promptly repairs and reactivates the former sky soldier. Though they were believed to have gone extinct, when the Naga Empire resumes the invasion it started 1,000 years ago, Rodea must take flight to keep the promise he made to defend Garuda once again!",

  "description": "Pokémon Jupiter is a ROM hack of Pokémon Ruby.\r\n\r\nIn a faraway place only known as the Mynoan Civilization, a great Deluge threatens the Mynoan existance. It has completely flooded the civilization and all that exists is the highest point of the Capitol. Ivan and a mysterious man named Charon flee through a portal to the world of Pokémon...\r\n\r\nBefore they leave, Charon gives the instruction to Ivan to find him as soon as possible, as they would probably be seperated.\r\n\r\nIvan arrives on the beach of Route 300, which is near Aleph Town, and a man named Fabio Pink finds him unconcious. He brings him to his house, and lets Ivan stay there for a while. However, Ivan leaves to go north, where he finds a Pokémon Trainer named Rachel being attacked by a Pokémon. Ivan uses a Pokémon from her bag with ease, and defeats it. They meet up in the Aleph Town Bar and Grill to give the \r\nPokémon to Ivan. She then leaves to go west to Styxwater Town.",

  "description": "Only If is a surreal first person adventure-puzzle game. You play as Anthony Clyde, who, after a heavy night of partying, wakes up to find himself in an unfamiliar bed with no memory of the previous night's events. Unfortunately, escaping these unfamiliar, opulent surroundings will prove to be no easy task, as an unseen, menacing, radio-bound antagonist will stop at nothing to block Anthony's path at every turn.\r\n\r\nThe game's mechanics are designed to be experimental and unpredictable, to defy the logic of \"What you see is what you get\". Is the environment changing around you, or is it your imagination? Will jumping to your death kill you, or will it save you? Could the wrong answer actually turn out to be the right answer?\r\n\r\nIn Only If, you will fail a lot, you will die a lot, and you will undoubtedly be confused. Or will you?",

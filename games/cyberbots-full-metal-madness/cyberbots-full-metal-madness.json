  "description": "Set at the end of the 21st century, mankind has expanded beyond the limits of Earth and begun to colonize the depths of space. Defending Earth’s interests and serving as the colonies’ primary line of defense is the Earth Force, an army of gigantic mechs and the crack pilots who fly them. Now, you must pick a pilot from a cast of six different characters and one of twelve unique and powerful mechs, then duke it out in classic 2D style! As you win battles, upgrade and customize your mech with new parts and weapons, all while uncovering more about Earth Force and its nefarious experiments. Their work, along with the actions of your character, will determine Earth’s future!",

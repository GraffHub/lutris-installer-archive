  "description": "The golden age of Ancient Greece. A time of men and gods. A place of myths and legends. Where errant Heroes vie with preternatural forces while their gods stand aloof and disinterested.\r\n\r\nBut history is always written by the victor and the tale herein related tells a different story. A chapter from the Unwritten Histories, Myth recounts the struggle of the Olympian deities as they battle to maintain their religious monopoly in the face of the gathering storm of Christianity.\r\n\r\nAt once poignant, subtle and self-affacing, Myth takes a light-hearted look at the roots of popular mythology through the eyes of Poseidon, god of the sea as he travels The Underworld in search of the fable Dark Helmet of Hades.",

This is where his long odyssey begins, in which he will learn how to use the colors around him to gain powerful abilities and transform the world. \r\n\r\nHowever, his experiences come at a high price. The Void must be one. It seeks to reclaim him and will never stop chasing him, destroying everything in its path along the way. \r\nTo survive, Born will have to condemn the earth he walks to its inevitable obliteration by The Void... \r\n\r\nAdvise: Nihilumbra has been designed in a way that everyone can enjoy its story, even without previous experience with puzzle games. However, players seeking for a challenge will find it on the second half of the game: the Void Mode. ",

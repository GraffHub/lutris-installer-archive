  "description": "In the games' story, an evil witch named Scylla (also known as Sculla and named differently in some countries, including \"Afskylia\" in the original Danish version) arrives at the home of Hugo the troll and kidnaps his wife Hugoline and their three young children (Rit, Rat and Rut) because she needs them for a magical beauty treatment. Hugo must reach and rescue Hugolina and the children, and defeat the witch to bring peace to the woods.\r\n\r\nThe player must complete a number of minigames and guessing games; most have 2.5D graphics and have Hugo controlled with button presses as he uses various means of transportation. Meanwhile, Scylla watches Hugo's progress through a crystal ball and casts spells to stop him, having previously placed all sorts of traps in the various paths leading to her lair in the Skull Cave at a mountain peak. Hugo will typically start each scenario with three lives, triggering a cutscene when any is lost. During the games Hugo (voiced in Danish by Michael Brockdorf and German by Michael Habeck, Oliver Grimm and Oliver Baier) and Scylla (voiced in Danish by Winnie Engell and in German by Karin Kernke) communicate with the player with digitized speech, and can also knock on (or scratch) the screen from the inside, breaking the fourth wall.",

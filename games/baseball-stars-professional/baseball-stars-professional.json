  "description": "Baseball Stars (ベースボールスター2 Bēsubōru Sutā ) is a 2-player baseball sports arcade game released by SNK in 1992 for the Neo-Geo console. A less detailed console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.\r\n\r\nThe Neo-Geo version was released for Virtual Console on December 10, 2007 and the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii as part of SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1.\r\nThe Neo Geo version was critically acclaimed. The first issue of GameFan reviewed the Neo Geo version, with its two reviewers scoring it 99% and 97%; the former said it \"is far and away the best sports game I have ever played\" and the latter said the \"graphics are incredibly well detailed\" and \"the gameplay is unparalleled.\" They concluded that it \"has the best graphics, sound, and game play this side of ESPN.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe NES version was less popular than the original Baseball Stars was on the NES. Reasons for this included the inability to change the name of a gamer-created team or names of the players on a gamer-created team, and unimproved graphics over the original.",

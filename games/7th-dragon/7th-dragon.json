Each character can be defined as one of seven classes, each of which has four unique appearances; after creation, characters can be further customized by learning abilities from skill trees in order to customize their role in battle. A player's guild can have up to sixteen characters total, up to four of whom can be selected at a time to form a party. The core of the game is structured around quests, which are available from quest boards in each town; these can range from simple fetch quests to complex quests involving dungeon crawling and travelling the world.",

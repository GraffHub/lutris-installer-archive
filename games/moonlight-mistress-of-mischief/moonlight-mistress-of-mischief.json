  "description": "You are Moonlight. You know only the ways of the thief. Your knife is the only friend you've ever known. What is theirs is yours tonight.\r\n\r\nMoonlight: Mistress of Mischief follows the adventures of the titular character as she ransacks her way through multiple castles with ever increasing odds stacked against her. Though a classic puzzle game at first glance along the lines of Crusher or Pac Man, Moonlight also has stealth mechanics to up the challenge. Keep clear of guards, turrets, traps, and more. Hide in crates and shank unsuspecting guards in the back with your trusty knife. Collect all the gems you can and find the way out of each room.\r\n\r\nThe game was created for the 2012 Stealth Jam. It currently features 2 castles with 5 levels each.",

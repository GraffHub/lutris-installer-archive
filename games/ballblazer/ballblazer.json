  "description": "Ballblazer: the simplest, fastest, and most competitive sport in the known universe. It grew from dark roots in ancient space wars to become king of all games among every lifeform within range of Interstellar Ethercast. In exactly three minutes, Ballblazer can make you a hero -- or destroy a lifetime of dreams.\r\n\r\nThe year is 3097, and the place is a null-gravity nexus mid-space in the binary star system of Kalaxon and Kalamar. Minutes from now, on the luminous surface of an artificial asteroid, the final round of the Interstellar Ballblazer Championship -- the greatest tournament of all time and space -- will begin, and history will be made. For the first time a creature from the planet Earth has battled through the countless qualifying rounds and eliminations, enduring and then triumphing, across vast parsecs, to win the right to compete for Earth's honor and the ultimate title any being can possess: Masterblazer.",

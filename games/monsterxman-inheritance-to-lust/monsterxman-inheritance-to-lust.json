  "description": "In a world inhabited by monsters, mankind is under perdition under the rule of a wicked Baroness. \r\nYou, the player, are brought into this world by some power unknown, to experience and live throughout it. \r\nWill you become a friend to the monsters around you, or will you fall beneath the heels of an insidious world? \r\n\r\nThis is a semi linear adventure that takes inspiration from Shin Megami Tensei, and is all about interacting with everything and everyone around you. You can talk to enemies, and even recruit/ date specific ones! There are tons of minigames and a deep lore that exists for those who wish to fulfill the entire quest. Loads of easter eggs hidden as well, and the game, while forgiving, is quite hard.",

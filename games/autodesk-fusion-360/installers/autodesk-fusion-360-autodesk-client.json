  "notes": "Notes about the Installer:\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- The GUI's floating tooltip/toolsettings windows seem to float above anything, resize them once for a small amount to stop them from staying on top of everything, some menues also need to be clicked once too.\r\n- Some native dialogs like a filepicker can pop up under a floating window from Fusion. It can be tricky to get to that window sometimes.\r\n- Do not try to use the \"Learning Panel\"\r\n\r\nMANUAL TASKS:\r\n- The installer will, after downloading files and applying patched, launch the 'fusion installer'. It will look frozen for a while while it is downloading the fusion files\r\n- Once it's done, the login page will pop up\r\n- After login you'll need to change the grapics driver to DirectX 9:\r\n(check this video: https://imgur.com/a/oZCuoP2)\r\n  - Go to your preferences by clicking on your name on the top right\r\n  - Under Graphics Driver, select DirectX 9\r\n  - Hit Apply\r\n  - Don't Restart! Instead, kill the lutris-wrapper process with your task-manager\r\n  - Now the scrip will patch some things again and launch (the now installed) Fusion\r\n  - Test around and check if you can create a sketch and draw around\r\n  - After testing, you might need to kill the lutris-wrapper again to fully close it for the first time\r\n  - Now everything is finished\r\n\r\nThis install script has been tested with a intel cpu and integrated graphics and a amd ryzen cpu with amd radeon gpu",

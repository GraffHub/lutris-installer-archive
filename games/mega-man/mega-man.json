  "description": "It's MEGA MAN versus the powerful leaders and fighting forces of Monsteropolis - that strange multi-layered land of robot-like Humanoids created by the wrongly-performed experiments with human beings by Dr. Wily.\r\n\r\nMEGA MAN - the chosen defender of the human race. For he dares to single-handedly penetrate Monsteropolis' seven separate societies to stop the rapid expansion of strange misrepresentations of humans.\r\n\r\nMEGA MAN's goal is monumental. He must infiltrate seven separate heavily-guarded empires. By himself, he must break-down and destroy the followers of empire leaders: Cutman, Gutsman, Iceman, Bombman, Fireman, Elecman and Dr. Wily.\r\n\r\nThe action involves MEGA MAN, armed only with laser beam weapons, encountering strangely-configured Humanoids. They're atop, in and out of fortified prison-like structures strengthened with thick walls. Below icefields. Hidden amid gun turrets imbedded in concrete uprights, even in subterranean passages under icefields. WOW!\r\n\r\nWill you and Mega Man penetrate the seven separate societies of Dr. Wily and preserve the human race? You're in control!",

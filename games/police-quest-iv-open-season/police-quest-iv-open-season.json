  "description": "Police Quest IV: Open Season was the fourth game in the Police Quest series. It was the first game by ex-LAPD police chief Darryl F. Gates, who would act as the principal consultant for the SWAT series. Rather than focusing on Sonny Bonds from fictional Lytton, CA, Police Quest IV follows a Los Angeles police homicide detective named John Carey. He has to investigate a series of murders which seem to be completely random and not connected to each other.",

  "description": "Installs the game and the necessary patches to launch and run the game relatively smoothly on Linux.  The game is run using Xephyr to satisfy the 16-bit color requirement.",
  "notes": "When the Midtown Madness 2 installer has finished, do not click \"Play Now\", as the game will not launch.  Close the window and allow the Lutris installer to continue.\r\n\r\nNote: After installation, the game will launch without the CD, but the CD needs to be inserted for the music to work.  If there is still no music, make sure MIDTOWN (the data portion of the CD) is mounted in the file manager.\r\n\r\nFun fact:  As the music uses CD audio, you can stick the Midtown Madness CD in your CD player and listen to the game's soundtrack!",

The goal is to find the best solution to create an algorithm that takes these robots into victory capsules.\r\n\r\nIn this videogame, the player is introduced into a 3d world filled with levels where the main objective is to help one or more robots to reach the capsules by assigning commands or actions (such as to forward, to turn, to jump, and others) that are logically programmable and iconographic, the latter to facilitate the understanding and learning of the player. On the other hand, with the passage of levels, the difficulty of the game increases, challenging the player with new challenges that encompass the sequential, repetitive and conditional control structures of programming in general, as well as inciting the player to apply the reuse and reduction of commands that are equivalent to the real programming code.\r\n\r\nRobo Do It have two game modes, the game arcade and the level editor. In the game arcade you need to solve forty eight levels along four chapters and in the level editor you will use your skills to create a great, funny and complex level what you can test and share with players community. Also you can follow, download, play, get score and rate like bad or nice level from another players levels!\r\n\r\nGet the best score by collecting all gems in game, getting a better time and using less commands to reach de victory!",

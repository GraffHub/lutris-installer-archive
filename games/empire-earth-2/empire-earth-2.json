  "description": "As with previous installments in the series, Empire Earth 2 challenges you to create, build, and lead a civilization to transcend the ages. Empire Earth 2, however, builds the series by adding new units, powers, leaders, and bonuses to all of the game's 14 civilizations. Cities, territories, and borders are now tradable resources, much like they are in the real world. For the first time in the series, ambient weather and seasons with fog and snowfall affect gameplay, forcing players to adapt their strategies to the changing environment.",

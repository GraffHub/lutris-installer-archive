  "description": "New Super Luigi U is an expansion for New Super Mario Bros. U. It replaces Mario with Luigi as Player 1, with Blue Toad, Yellow Toad, Nabbit and Mii as playable characters. Luigi has his own abilities, higher jump and lower traction, to help him in the redesigned levels that now have increased in difficulty and start at one hundred seconds. While the levels have a major makeover, the World Map itself remains unchanged. Challenge Mode and Boost Rush, from the original game, are no longer available.\r\n\r\nThe retail version of the game is a standalone release that doesn't require New Super Mario Bros. U to play.",

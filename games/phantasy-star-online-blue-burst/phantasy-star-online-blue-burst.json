  "description": "Phantasy Star Online makes its way to the PC in this download only edition. You play the role of a Hunter on Planet Ragol, traversing the lush landscapes of the planet and making a name for yourself. Real time battles against a number of deadly creatures, powerful enemies and many more will await you on your journey, while collecting a number of weapons and items that will aid you. Your main quest, as requested by Governor-General Tyrell, is to discover any survivors of a tragic explosion in the Central Dome.\r\n\r\nNew missions have been developed based around the offline adventures of Phantasy Star Online Episodes I & II, while you customize the 12 characters on offer, from the items they wear to their looks, thanks to a new morphing technology.

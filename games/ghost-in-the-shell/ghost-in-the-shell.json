Over twelve missions, you must control \"The Puppet Master\" - a once organic being, now trapped in virtual form. \r\n\r\nOriginally created by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an Artificial Intelligence, the Puppet Master is constantly in search of a new host body to inhabit the real world, and it finds a possible candidate in the form of Major Motoko Kusanagi - a highly-trained female agent. Kusanagi has been sent to counter the Puppet Master's threat but it soon becomes clear that far from being a terrorist, the Puppet Master is trying to uncover corruption at the heart of Government. \r\n\r\nThen the Puppet Master contacts Kusanagi and makes her an offer - access to unlimited information in return for... her body!",

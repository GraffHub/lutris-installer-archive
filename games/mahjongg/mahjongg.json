  "description": "Mahjongg is a solitaire (one player) version of the classic Eastern tile game, Mahjongg. The objective is to select pairs of similar tiles.\r\n\r\nMahjongg's origins are not fully known, but many theories have been put forth. One such theory says that Noah played Mahjongg on the ark because the East hand is dominant, presumably the direction the rains came, in the flood. Another theory says that the Chinese philosopher, Confucius, made the game.",

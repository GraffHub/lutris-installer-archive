  "description": "Brawling has never been more beautiful! The long-awaited sequel to the smash hit action-platformer is here: Guacamelee! 2 brings luchador Juan Aguacate out of retirement for a stunning new Metroidvania-style adventure.\r\n\r\nExplore a huge, hand-crafted world inspired by Mexican culture and folklore, filled with sassy new villains and weirdos (and a few old friends!). Learn a deep repertoire of bone-crunching moves to fend off the skeletal hordes and overcome a multitude of platforming challenges.\r\n...and who said anything about a Chicken Illuminati? Certainly not us!\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n-    New moves like Eagle Boost, Pollo Shot and more add to Juan’s arsenal of combat and platforming abilities.\r\n-    New powers for Juan’s chicken form! Ridiculous chicken-based platforming, combat and exploration. More chicken than you’ll be able to handle (probably).\r\n-    An epic adventure through the worlds of the living and the dead, across rifts in time and space -- more gorgeous than ever thanks to a fancy new rendering engine.\r\n-    Bigger maps, twice as many enemy types as the first game, and a roster of eccentric new bosses.\r\n-    Discover “trainers” from around the world, defeat their challenges, and upgrade your abilities.\r\n-    Soundtrack featuring new music from the composers of the original Guacamelee! OST, plus tracks from special guests Mariachi Entertainment System!\r\n-    Drop-in / drop-out 4-player local co-op through the entire story.",

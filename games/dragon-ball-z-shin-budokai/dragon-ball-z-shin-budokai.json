The fast and furious combat rockets into a new dimension, with all the ounter-attacks, super high-speed bouts, flight and Ki (energy) management you've come to expect. Challenge some of the most evil characters in single-player mode, or select multiplayer and play as the bad guys themselves. The choice is yours -- either way, you'll fight hard to reach your goal: Becoming the most feared and powerful warrior in the universe!",

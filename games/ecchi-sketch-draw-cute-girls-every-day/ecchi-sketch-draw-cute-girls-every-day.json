  "description": "Ecchi Sketch: Draw Cute Girls Every Day follows the story of Yume Akiyama, a girl in her mid twenties who works at a real 'dead-end' job - at a funeral company. Her real passion, however, is anything girl x girl - manga, anime, videogames; if it has cute girls romancing other cute girls, then she's a fan.\r\n\r\nA talented amateur artist, Yume is suddenly given the opportunity of a lifetime - to be a mangaka at a manga studio! But with so many other attractive girls at the office... will she be able to concentrate?",

Avoid running out of fuel as you outmaneuver, bomb or blast away the fireballs corning at you-while bombing SKELETOR on the ground below. If you get HE-MAN near enough to CASTLE GRAYSKULL™. he fights on foot with just his shield- through lightning-balls, power-bolts and magic swords- to get at SKELETOR!",

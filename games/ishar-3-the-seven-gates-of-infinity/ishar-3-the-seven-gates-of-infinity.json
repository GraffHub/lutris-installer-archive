  "description": "So many battles... so much slaughter... and still there is no peace!\r\n\r\nThe shadow of Chaos once more darkens the spires of the Citadel, for the evil spirit of Shandar seeks reincarnation in the vast body of the lord of Sith -- last and most powerful of the ancient Black Dragons.\r\n\r\nIshar 3 - The Seven Gates of Infinity offers a role-playing adventure that surpasses its enormously popular predecessors: more than 100 characters with unique and life-like personalities (including animal companions). Ishar 3 also includes richly satisfying magic and combat systems with lush, spectacular night-and-day graphics, a challenging new time-travel feature, auto-mapping, extensive use of full-motion animated sequences, unlimited save-game facility and much, much more.\r\n\r\nThe gates of Time are opening. Do you have the courage to pass through their mysterious portals?",

  "description": "Experience life in the Dark Ages as a feudal aristocrat. \r\n\r\nSuperstition, the sword, and chance rule the day, and a shuffle of the cards can determine your fate. Your noble position means that tough decisions must be made, and you are the one to make them, for good or ill. The drawing of the Tarot casts the events of your life, bringing new events, conflicts, and leads you along the path of your destiny. \r\n\r\n Will you be a cruel dictator, or a ruler for the people? Will you gain prestige in the Royal Court, or become a pariah among the nobility? Will you show honour and bravery, or be forever scarred by your decisions? Pick a card, and let fortune guide the way.",

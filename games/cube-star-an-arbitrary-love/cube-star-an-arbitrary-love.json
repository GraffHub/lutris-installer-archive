  "description": "\"Spread color. Spread joy. Thrill to the emergence of strange new creatures. And burn them all to ashes.\"\r\n\r\nCube & Star: An Arbitrary Love is a surreal open-world exploration game about the creation of life, joy and the pointlessness of existence.\r\n\r\nEat fruit, nudge trees, stain the ground and thrill to the emergence of strange and vapid creatures in your fool's errand to reunite the Ancient Cube and Star.\r\n\r\nDay breaks, grass grows, night falls, stars fall from the sky, trees shed their fruit...\r\n\r\nAnd across the world other cubes like yourself are bounding around, each with their own tiny opinions to impart to you... if you have the patience to listen.\r\n\r\nAs the grey world comes to life - secrets emerge from the ground: discover ancient relics, bizarre monetary tokens and personal journal entries left by cubes long gone.\r\n\r\nFill your void with knowledge, flood the world with color, burn the world to ashes - and watch as an ancient entity is reborn.\r\n\r\nAnd relax....",

  "description": "The insect invasion has begun…\r\n\r\nThe galaxy is being infested by the evil Mizar and his horde of Drones. Already, the planet of Goldwood has been subjugated and the peaceful Tribals enslaved. With an arsenal of mega weapons at their disposal, the Jet Force Gemini team must travel in search of Mizar’s liar – rescuing Tribals and splattering Drones all along the way. But can Juno, Vela and their faithful dog, Lupus, exterminate the deadly threat before it’s too late?\r\n\r\n* Decimate your enemy with weapons such as the Plasma Shotgun, Tri-Rocket Launcher and heat-seeking Shuriken throwing star.\r\n* Take on the bugs as a team when you play as Juno and Floyd the robot in the 2-player Co-op Mode.\r\n* Do unto others… Blast your friends in 4-player Battle Mode!\r\n* Dazzling cinematic sequences add even more excitement to this already intense interstellar adventure!",

  "description": "Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride comes racing onto Game Boy Advance with one wild and hilarious joy-riding jaunt. As a fearless cabbie with attitude, you're driven by a single goal: to rack up the mega-bucks in fares and tips before your shift ends. It's a race against the clock as you pick up passengers and white-knuckle it through busy streets and back alleys to their various destinations. And time is money! So get a grip on the wheel, sharpen your senses, and don't lose your cool.",

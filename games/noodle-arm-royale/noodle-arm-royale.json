  "description": "Noodle Arm Royale was built for a Philadelphia event called NotAtSXSW as an experiment for the Microsft Kinect. Two players stand in front of the Kinect and use their bodies to control two old-timey boxers as they have a battle royale atop a moving traincar, however their arms are long and noodley, and the only attacks are in the form of slap-fighting. The result is an old-fashioned slap battle, forcing players to wildly waggle their arms to defeat their opponent. The game was a hit at the event, and was later brought to PAX East in Boston, where it was showcased to hundreds of players on the convention floor.",

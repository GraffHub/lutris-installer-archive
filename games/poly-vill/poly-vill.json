Grow your planet, fight natural disasters, and make your village come to life!\r\nAlthough there will be challenges in the game, you can freely add as many rocks, trees, animals, and other wildlife you want without having to unlock them.\r\nThe difficulties of the game will be, for example, disease spreading, asteroids, and other things.\r\nWe are currently giving this as a prototype since this is the beginning of the game's development.\r\nIf you find any bugs with the game, please let us know in the comments below.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

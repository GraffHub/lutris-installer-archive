  "description": "You can almost feel the tension of the big match breaking through the screen.... the expectant crowd is almost on top of you! You return the service with a top spin backhand, then a forward back-spin, the ball bounces high from your opponent's looping, defensive lob...SMASH!... a great shot opens the score... but this is only your first point! Play head-to-head or against the computer in this; Konami's first and best table-tennis simulation.",

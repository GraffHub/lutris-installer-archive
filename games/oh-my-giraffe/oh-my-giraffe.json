  "description": "A game about a giraffe eating fruit while being chased by lions. \r\nYou have to snap the vines of some of the fruits. This will cause them to fall and hit the lions in the face. \r\nYou get points for eating fruit, and as long you keep up eating the fruits you'll get more and more points for each one. Specifically, it's additive combo system (each fruit adds one point to your combo), and your combo stays alive as long as you eat a fruit every few seconds.",

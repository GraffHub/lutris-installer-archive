  "description": "â€‹Inspired by creepy/bad edutainment games from the 90s, Baldi's Basics is a meta horror game that's really weird, with no real educational value to be found. Collect all 7 of the notebooks and escape the school, all while avoiding Baldi. Baldi has many friends in the school that will slow down your progress and put you at risk of being caught, so learn how each character works and how you can use them to your advantage. Find items and use them wisely to better your chances of winning. This game is fun, creepy, really weird, and free, so go ahead and check it out!",

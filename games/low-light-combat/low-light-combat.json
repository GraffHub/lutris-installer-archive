  "description": "Low Light Combat is a multiplayer stealth shooter for Mac, Windows, and Linux, created for the Mojam 2 charity drive. The game is about nuclear-powered cyberninjas who decide world issues for the Illuminati via proxy battles, after traveling to a deserted ice cave in a submarine. Each ninja only has enough power to survive sixty seconds, so they can only survive by stealing power from one another, or fighting for control of a central nuclear charging station.",

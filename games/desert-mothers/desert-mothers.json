  "description": "Desert Mothers is a multiplayer virtual reality meditation circle. Players begin in the same procedurally-generated environment.  This diverges for each as their personal environment, composed of individualized weather and hallucinations, responds emotionally to the player's actions.\r\n\r\nThe constraints within which the players interact are discovered during play, and revolve around the body, simulated breath, drawing in the air, and out-of-body exploration of flora, fauna, and abandoned human habitations.",

  "description": "Escape Velocity is an open-ended, role-playing arcade game set in a future where interstellar space travel has allowed mankind to expand its reach to countless unique solar-systems. The game is presented from a top-down, slightly isometric-view in which players control a pilot of one of the many space vessels the game has to offer. Traveling between the various different star-systems in the game is done through hyperspace travel, whereas sub-space travel is used for manual maneuvers, such as landing/docking and space combat.",

  "description": "The Blitz companion app for League of Legends.\r\n\r\nBlitz uses the League Client APIs to automatically identify your champion and recommend the best runes and builds to counter your specific lane opponent. We also grab your teammate's Summoner Names when you enter champion select and automatically display their strengths and ranked win rates on their chosen champion.\r\n\r\nWhen you are not in game, Blitz builds a personalized profile of your unique strengths and weaknesses so you can improve over time.\r\n\r\nBlitz does not use any stats from other third party applications/sites.\r\n\r\nWe fetch all our data directly from the Riot's League of Legends API and analyze them ourselves. All recommendations and stats currently come from Platinum + ranked games worldwide.\r\n\r\nYou will not get banned for using Blitz since it doesn't give you any advantages in game. You still have to play like everyone else. In fact many Rioters are using Blitz too!\r\n\r\nWe talk with Riot before developing any major features to make sure they are okay with what we are doing!",

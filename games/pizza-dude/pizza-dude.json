  "description": "The Pizzadude family is in panic! Uncle Francesco left Kevin and Kimberly because he can not pay his bills anymore. Their poor uncle is ashamed of himself! There is only one chance to get their fat Uncle Francesco back: Earn loads of money, within 24 hours, with the pizza restaurant ! \r\n\r\nEarning money requires a lot of work. After taking the order by phone, they have to prepare the order in the kitchen, by preparing all the pizza-ingredients (cheese, pepperoni, tomato, ananas, onions, etc, etc) and also prepare other extra orders (fries, soda, salad). \r\n\r\nAfter finishing the pizza one of them has to drive in Kevin''s supercharged quad to the customer: and here the difficult part starts! \r\nIf the Pizza is delivered too late, the customer will not pay for his pizza. Because of this ''golden rule'', all pizza customers will try to make your delivery as hard as possible. Their loose (wild) dogs and many other obstacles will make you use your jump and run action to the max.",

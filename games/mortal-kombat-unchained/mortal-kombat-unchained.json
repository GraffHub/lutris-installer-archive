  "description": "Mortal Kombat: Unchained is the portable equivalent of the console game Mortal Kombat: Deception. It contains all the characters from the GameCube version, along with four exclusive to the PSP version: Blaze, Frost, Jax and Kitana. In this installment of the 3D beat-em-up series, an ancient evil has returned. The characters fight to become the Champion of the Elder Gods to earn the power to challenge and defeat this evil.\r\n\r\nAll characters have a vast arsenal of moves, with weapons, and fatalities. The arenas are multi-tiered, interactive and contain death traps. Next to the regular battles, you can play a free-roaming adventure in the Konquest Mode, battle an endless wave of opponents in the Endurance Mode (exclusive for the PSP), go head-to-head over Wi-Fi against another human player, or try a mini-game such as Chess Kombat (chess with the MK characters) and Puzzle Kombat (Tetris with a twist).",

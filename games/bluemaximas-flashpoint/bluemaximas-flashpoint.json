  "description": "Internet history and culture is important, and content made on web platforms including, but not limited to Adobe Flash, make up a significant portion of that culture. This project is dedicated to preserving as many experiences from these platforms as possible, so that they aren't lost to time.\r\n\r\nFlashpoint was started in January 2018 by BlueMaxima in an attempt to outrun the disappearance of content prior to the death of Flash. It has since evolved into an international project involving over 100 contributors, encompassing both webgames and animations created for numerous internet plugins, frameworks, and standards.",

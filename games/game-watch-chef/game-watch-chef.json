  "description": "In the game, three types of food will fly out into the kitchen (in beginning of the game, it actually shows that there were originally three chefs who flipped food into the air, but two of them left leaving only you to flip them all), and as the chef your goal is to cook them all at the same time. To do this, you'll use a frying pan to flip the food back into the air, cooking them bit by bit. Once the food starts to come back down, you have to prepare yourself by going under it as not to let it hit the floor. If a piece of the food hits the floor, then you'll lose one life (the player has three lives in all). The cat at the left of the stage will sometimes use a fork to hold the food, which is meant to catch the player off guard. Following this, he'll drop it rather than tossing it in the air, which will give you little time to go over to flip it. In Game B you will have to cook four meals instead of three.",

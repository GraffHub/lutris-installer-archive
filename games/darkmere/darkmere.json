  "description": "Viewed isometrically, Darkmere sets you as Ebryn, the son of the former King of Darkmere, a barren cursed land, with the aim of discovering what happened, and how to put it right. The area is besieged by problems, including orcs running riot, and racial tension between different species.\r\n\r\nA number of quests unfold as you aim to complete the task, with people offering to help if you collect a particular artifact, for example. All combat is conducted using a magic blade. Its power level of which is boosted when you kill evil characters, and reduced when you kill good or innocent ones, which extends the feeling of a battle between good and evil.",

  "notes": "The only issue I'm having is with the lutris setup - if I use DXVK, version 1.4, the game runs at the same framerate as on Win10, but the wrestlers, during a match, are all black, as well as they noclip in the ring. If I use DX9K instead, wrestlers look fine, there are no graphical issues, but the framerates drop and the game becomes nearly unplayable.\r\nMy specs:\r\nMotherboard: ASRock Fatal1ty B450 Gaming K4\r\nProcessor: AMD Ryzen 2200G\r\nVideo Card: Integrated, from the CPU - Vega 8\r\nRam: 8gb 2666 Mhz\r\nHDD 7200",

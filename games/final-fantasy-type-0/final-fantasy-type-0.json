Imperial dreadnoughts swarmed the skies, assailing the unsuspecting countryside under the banner of the White Tiger. From amidst the flames of the besieged dominion, the Vermilion Bird rose in defiance, her crystal granting magic and mighty eidolons that her disciples might cast out the technologically advanced aggressors.\r\n\r\nThrust into the tumult of war, the fate of the world and its four crystals now rests on the shoulders of fourteen brave, young warriors.",

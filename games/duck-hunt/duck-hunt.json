Your fingers tighten around your Zapper \"light gun.\" Suddenly, there's a duck in the air! You've only got three shots to bag this duck, and if you miss, even your dog laughs at you! But become a sharp-shooter, and you'll progress to the next round where two ducks fly up at the same time. And then you're on to the ultimate challenge: Clay Shooting. Where you'll compete in a wild clay pigeon shooting contest! Play DUCK HUNT and discover you can have lots of laughs and be challenged at the same time.",

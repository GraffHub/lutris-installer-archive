  "description": "You build your own AC units with more than 500 parts to choose from and engage in various challenging missions as a mercenary pilot. Ad-hoc wireless play allows up to 4 players to battle together. The key controls are 100% customizable. Part breaking feature adds some reality to the game. The game is fully localized into English and the branching story evokes a lot of aspects of the in-game world from different perspectives. The game save from AC3 Portable and ACSL Portable can be carried over to this game. Everything in this game is enhanced.",

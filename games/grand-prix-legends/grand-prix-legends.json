  "description": "It was a time when racing circuits were designed to test the limits of man and not for safety. A time when a driverÂ’s talent mattered more than his machinery.\r\n\r\nGrand Prix Legends captures this experience in one of the most accurate and compelling racing simulations ever created. Based on an advanced 3-D modeling engine, the driving feel has been authentically created. Cars slide, drift, bounce and skid with frightening realism. As your skills improve, you can start giving the legends of the era some serious competition: race against greats like Jack Brabham, Jum Clark and Graham Hill.",

  "description": "IonBall 2: Ionstorm is an arcade game with a modern 3D twist; re-live the joys and frustrations (in equal measure) of classics games such as Breakout and Arkanoid, in a no holds barred fast action game with stunning 3D environments, awesome effects and a thumping soundtrack.\r\n\r\nBattle through 60 formidable levels and 3 boss levels with a multitude of enemies; each with their own unique abilities. Upgrade your armament from a range of weaponry such as the mighty machine-gun upgrade for the ball, or the rampant rail-gun for your bat; Ionball 2: Ionstorm will set blood pumping and pulse racing like no other ball game before it!",

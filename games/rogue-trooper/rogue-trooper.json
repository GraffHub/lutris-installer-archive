A futile struggle on a hostile planet with no end in sight.\r\n\r\nBut there are tales of a lone warrior. A man who can appear out of thin air and take out whole platoons, then disappear back into the shadows to which he belongs. A man who knows no allegiance but to his own mission and is hell-bent on revenge. He is the ultimate soldier, the last survivor of the massacred Genetic Infantrymen...\r\n\r\n...the Rogue Trooper!",

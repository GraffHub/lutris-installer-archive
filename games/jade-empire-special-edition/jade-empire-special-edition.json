  "description": "The fate of an empire is in your hands. Will you save or doom the ancient realm? The Jade Empire suffers from the violent upheaval of rebellion. The once-beloved Emperor Sun Hai falls prey to a corrupting influence that turns his brothers against him. Now, you must choose sides as the dark mysteries of the crumbling empire unfurl before you: why do the dead now walk the earth? What has caused Sun Hai to become twisted and evil? What was your role in the past and what is your destiny for the future?\r\n\r\nStep into the role of an aspiring martial-arts master and follow the path of the open palm or the closed fist. In this multi-award-winning action-RPG, your choices and actions will determine the fate of the entire Jade Empire. Will you prevent the destruction of this beautiful land, or will you crush it beneath your heel? Are you a warrior who uses his strength and fighting mastery to bring peace, or will you instead use your power to bring pain and ruin? The choice is yours!\r\n\r\n    Forge a legendary tale where you control the outcome. Will you be a noble hero or a treacherous villain?\r\n    A bewildering variety of fighting styles, such as Iron Palm, Drunken Master, or White Demon, all easily accessible during combat.\r\n    Includes a new game+ mode, Jade Master, where you keep all of your styles and techniques from your previous playthrough and face much tougher foes.",

  "description": "You control the fate of the gallant Maximo, who returns home to find his kingdom in shambles. Your once-trusted advisor, Achille, has wrought evil on the land. Not only is the countryside filled with hordes of the roaming undead, but the four wise (and beautiful) sorceresses have been imprisoned at the four corners of the kingdom, and to make matters worse, your girlfriend, Princess Sophia, has been forced to marry the scoundrel Achille. Help Maximo rescue the sorceresses, restore good to the kingdom and get your girl back.\r\n\r\nMaximo: Ghosts to Glory is a 3D action game with an emphasis on combat. Maximo fights using his sword and shield, which can be upgraded and used in various combinations, inflicting damage on different types of enemies. His health is measured by the strength of his armor; once it is broken, Maximo will die from one hit. Coins can be collected and paid in order to ensure the possibility to continue playing the game following Maximo's death.",

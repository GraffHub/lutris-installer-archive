She needs some help before its too late, but is there anybody out there who has the patience to teach her?!\r\n\r\nRead the story from Ceren’s perspective, choose which subject you want to focus on, and see who your tutor will be. With six different tutors and six possible outcomes, perhaps Ceren will make new friends, new enemies, or even fall in love! ☆",

  "description": "A long time ago Brathian was a land full of magical energy.\r\nMany wars were fought for that kind of magic and so, to bring peace back, the elders decided to seal as much magical energy as they could in one crystal and hide it.\r\nMany years passed, and the books telling this story were found. Someone read the books awakening the guardians of the crystal and shaking Brathian.\r\nThe descendants of the elders, Edgar and Amy, took to themselves the duty to defeat the guardians, gain their power to fight whoever is trying to take the crystal.",

  "notes": "GhostDog's PS:T UI mod v2.2\r\n- Added support for the Chinese version of PST.\r\n- All movies are now stretching to full-screen.\r\n\r\nBy Ghostdog\r\nWith the help of Taplonaplo.\r\n\r\nThis mod is packed with WeiDU\r\n\r\nThis is a User Interface modification which in combination with Bigg's Widescreen Mod makes any resolution (except those below 800x480) viable for Planescape:Torment by changing a number of things in the user interface.\r\n\r\nThe Widescreen mod works well in Planescape: Torment, but unfortunately when you change the resolution, almost all of the UI elements and game effects are shown in the top-left area since they were set for the original 640x480 game resolution.\r\n\r\nWhat this mod does is center all of these elements and enhance the UI with original game art to fit nicely with any resolution. Additionally, bigger fonts are available for those with relatively small monitors.",

  "description": "Battle Buggy Grounds is a Top Down tank shooter game that lets you take control of a next-gen battle tank a.k.a. the Battle Buggy. You are equipped with weapons such as flame-throwers, spread shots and even a sledge hammer launcher guaranteed to send your foes back to the junkyard.\r\n\r\nThe main objective is to survive waves of merciless enemies as you progress through the increasingly challenging levels. Time is never on your side and the longer you take to try bring down the enemy, the worse your chances of survival get.\r\n\r\nYour reflexes and ability to strategize under enemy fire will be tested. Can you handle the Buggy?",

  "description": "AngerForce: Reloaded is an action-packed vertically scrolling shoot'em up game that pays homage to the classics of 90’s arcades. This high octane experience is set against the backdrop of a 19th century human world that has seen the outbreak of a robot rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe game uses an original cartoon/comic art style. Created using traditional 2D technology combined with a free-form deformation technique, character animation sequences are rich in detail, achieving a unique 3D-like effect.\r\n\r\nCharacters can be improved and enhanced through randomly generated abilities, with choices impacting your entire stage progression. Choose from dozens of upgrade choices to complement your characters’ special abilities, thereby creating a unique and personal play style.\r\n\r\nLeaderboards allow you to compare high scores, while replays can be recorded and shared for maximum gloating! The game also features a Local CO-OP mode that will enable you to explore the story alongside your friend.",

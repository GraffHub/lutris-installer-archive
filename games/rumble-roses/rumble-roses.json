  "description": "A wrestling game featuring a large and varied number of attractive women. The playable characters run the gamut: nurses, schoolgirls, cowgirls, ninjas, and many more. Each combatant has her own repository of clothes to choose from before each match, from a wide selection of standard wrestling outfits, to a series of bikinis, used mainly for the Mud Wrestling mode in the game.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the game revolves around the personalities of the fighters and the usage of the reputation system. Several matches will require that the player be sworn not to use dirty tactics such as using weapons found around the ring or even to humiliate the opponent. These oaths can be broken by the player, but the consequences are the loss of fan popularity and for the player's chosen character to develop a dark side to their persona.",

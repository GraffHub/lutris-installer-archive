  "description": "Castlevania was a cake walk compared to this bloody curse.\r\n\r\nYou thought you had the Prince of Darkness defanged- eh, Simon Belmont?\r\nWell think again, cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horryfying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts!\r\nTalk about your frightening quest, searching a maze of mansions, graveyards and dark, eerie forests - each guarded by man-eating werewolves, fire-throwing zombies and other devilish demons.\r\nYour grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains. And where you'll purchase magic weapons, including silver knives and flame whips.\r\nBut beware of the night. For when the sun disappears, Dracula's curse grows deadlier. And your chances grow dimmer and dimmer.",

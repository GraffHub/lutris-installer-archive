  "description": "Test your endurance and ability to the max with the ultimate off-road challenge. \r\n\r\nThis hair-raising sequel to the original Rally Cross lets you rip through 12 completely new terrains including dirt, gravel, sand, snow and ice as you try to survive the breakneck, hairpin bends or drive yourself straight at all your opponents in a mad suicide race. \r\n\r\nYou can choose from 10 all-new vehicles and completely customise them by adjusting the gearbox, tyres and breaks or completely re-spray the vehicle.\r\n\r\nIntuitive gameplay controls give you the choice of automatic or manual transmission. The unique Track Designer option also lets you create your own 3D terrains as you challenge yourself and your opponents through all those impossible bends and heart-stopping jump points.",

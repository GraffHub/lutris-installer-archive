  "description": "Just when the LocoRoco thought everyone was safe and happy, the nasty Moja Troop returns! The LocoRoco love to sing, but now the Moja have learned a song of their own - one so dreadful that it is able to suck out the life of all living things! The player must control the planet once more to not only protect the LocoRoco, but protect the entire planet itself!\r\n\r\nLocoRoco 2 is a sequel to the PSP game, LocoRoco. As with the original game, the player controls the planet, and tilts it by using the L and R Buttons on the PSP. By pressing both L and R simultaneously, the planet gives a shake and makes the LocoRoco jump. Tapping the Circle button scares the LocoRoco, making them split apart into smaller ones and allowing them to squeeze through gaps. Holding Circle merges them back into one large LocoRoco again.\r\n\r\nAs players explore the LocoRoco's world, they will encounter places poisoned by the Moja's awful singing. By hitting the black blobby areas with the LocoRoco, the poison will break off and restore the area to normal. Players can destroy Mojas themselves in the same way. As the LocoRoco explore the levels, they will discover musical notes - collecting enough of these will give the player bonus help in exploring the levels. Occasionally, players will encounter brief mini-games where they must tap the beat to the LocoRoco's songs to earn even more musical notes.",

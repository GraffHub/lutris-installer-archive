  "description": "is a classical \"coming-of-age\" tale.  You start as Benjamin, a farm boy, and if all goes well, after many adventures and hard choices, you end up as the new king. You start alone, but soon will have companions that'll help you with your tasks.\r\n\r\nExplore, fight and interact with NPCs  and your party. Difficult decisions and dangerous foes await you in dungeons and other environments.  If you played Moonstone Deep and put money in your bank account in Panzani Bank, you can retrieve some of your gold when you leave Netherim for good.",

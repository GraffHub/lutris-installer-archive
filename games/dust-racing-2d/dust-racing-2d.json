  "description": "Dust Racing 2D (dustrac) is an open source, tile-based 2D racing game developed by Jussi Lind and contributors.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the game is to race against challenging computer players on different race tracks. Finishing in TOP-6 will unlock a new race track. Only a small portion of the race track is visible on the scrolling screen.\r\n\r\nThere's also an option for a split-screen two player game, introduced in 0.12.0. Dust Racing 2D comes with a Qt-based level editor that makes creating new race tracks easy.",

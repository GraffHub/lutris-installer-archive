You can set one-time alarms or repeating alarms - activate only from Monday through Friday and give you a chance to sleep on the weekends.\r\n\r\nLabel different alarms to indicate activities you must do at the sound of the alarm. After you set the time and sound for each alarm, you can use a text field to write a note to yourself as a reminder about the alarm's purpose.",

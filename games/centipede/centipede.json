  "description": "You’re trapped in the perilous Enchanted Forest. Dark, dangerous mushrooms push up through the squishy forest floor, snaring you on every side. Threatening thumps and evil buzzings fill the air. Something slimy flashes through the mushrooms, moving in on you. Suddenly, glaring eyes and quivering antennae Jump out right at you! It’s the Centipede and it’s attacking!\r\n\r\nYou grab a stick and Jab It at the evil eyes. To your surprise, sparks blast from the magic stick, turning the Centipede’s head into a mushroom. But Instantly, another head grows back! You Jab and Jab again, destroying the Centipede before its diminishing body can grow new heads! But worse perils lurk in the forest-other, fiercer Centipedes, deadly Spiders, venomous fleas, poisonous Scorpions. You pick up two more sticks. With these magic wands, you might stay alive!",

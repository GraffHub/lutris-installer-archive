  "description": "Planetary Sanitations Inc. v0.3.0 released!\r\nPlanetary Sanitations Inc. is a roguelike mech dungeon-crawler (although there are planets, not dungeons ;) ). You can assemble a mech consisting of various modules that can also be destroyed individually in combat.\r\n\r\nCarry out missions and proceed to your next destination. Fight your way through hordes of space monsters and customize your mech with the loot you find... or end up being eaten up by space monsters.\r\n\r\nMost features are implemented by now. More missions and a proper story will be added later on.",

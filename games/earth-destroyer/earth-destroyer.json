  "description": "Can you imagine an alien invasion?\r\nWhich side you prefer to be? Destroyer or being destroyed?\r\nHave you ever wanted to press Red Button of the weapon of mass destruction?\r\nWill you miss the opportunity to demolish some of the famous landmarks on planet Earth?\r\n\r\nHopes not. Then try yourself as a warlike alien general. Your only mission is to deal as much damage as you can. But you have to spent your resources wisely so no one of miserable humans can avoid your wraith. Too brutal? Then imagine that this is just a puzzle game and do your job. Good luck, general!",

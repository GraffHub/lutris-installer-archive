  "description": "\"Clairvoyance is a multi-player online board game about robots, lasers and perceiving the future.\"\r\n\r\nA game of turn-based tactics for two players.  Allocate five commands in any order to up to four different robot units per turn, and attempt to destroy your opponent's pieces first with a mixture of grenades, lasers, and headstomps in a 3D environment.  Turns are simultaneous for both players; the goal is to predict your opponent's moves and outdo them as both your batched orders play out simultaneously.",

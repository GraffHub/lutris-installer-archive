  "description": " OpenClonk is a free multiplayer action game in which you control clonks, small but witty and nimble humanoid beings. The game is mainly about mining, settling and fast-paced melees.\r\n\r\nOpenClonk is not just a game but also a versatile 2D game engine that allows the creation of mods. It is the successor of the shareware game series Clonk and thus inherits many of its features.",

  "description": "Myst Online: Uru Live is a massive multiplayer online game (MMOG) unlike anything else. The very essence of Myst Online is to explore vast, fantastic worlds; savoring and uncovering new areas and new information at every turn. Exploring in Myst Online is an extraordinary experience, where immersing yourself in the environment gives you insight into how to move forward, and what went on before. You can explore alone, or share the journey with a select group friends or family from anywhere in the world. Create an online avatar and chat via text and voice, share images and clues, and explore the Ages of Myst Online together. You’ll rediscover, restore and rebuild the ancient city of D’ni and learn about the history of its fallen civilization.",

  "description": "Somewhere in a place known as Solar System #517, the evil Grax and his horde of Serpentbeasts are terrorizing the people of the eight worlds. A hero is needed who can run and jump. Jump between worlds, in fact. That hero is the WorldRunner.\r\n\r\n3-D WorldRunner is a 3rd person game, behind the player, moving \"forwards\" towards the screen and away from you. Your only skill is the ability to jump. Jump over holes, enemies and on top of columns. Bonus items are found in the air, on top of columns and laying on the ground. Additionally the game is viewable in 3-D with a pair of 3-D glasses (included in the original box).",

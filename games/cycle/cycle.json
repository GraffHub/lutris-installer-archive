But while facing a variety of new people and obstacles, can he change his rebellious nature and become a famous star? Or will he become an unknown newcomer who is a stepping stone for others? Or does he find his love and have a romance? Or will his girlfriend leave him, despite his tears streaming down his face?\r\nUnder the scrutiny of his ex-girlfriend, what is Liya's fate?",

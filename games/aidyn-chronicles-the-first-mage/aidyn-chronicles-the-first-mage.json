  "description": "You'll need all your monster-hunting, spell-casting and adventuring skills to master Aidyn Chronicles: The First Mage.\r\n\r\nCanadian codeshop H2O takes some liberties with the strict turn-based battles of conventional RPGs. Once a battle breaks out, you'll be able to move your character into a more strategic position. The battle system requires serious study.\r\n\r\nAssembling and leveling up a party of four (out of 13 selectable characters) and journeying through the vast tracts of medieval settings is not a job for the patience-impaired, but for RPG devotees, Aidyn Chronicles delivers the mystical goods.",

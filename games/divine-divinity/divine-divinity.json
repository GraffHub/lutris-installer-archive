  "description": "The land of Rivellon is about to collapse – dark, evil powers started a war with the people of the Seven Races. But there is still hope – the ancient prophecy about the chosen one may come true with your help, dear player. \r\n\r\nDivine Divinity is a role-playing game featuring a gameplay experience somewhere between Sacred and the Ultima series. You can choose from 3 typical character archetypes – Fighter, Mage and Survivor (Rogue-like class). Each one has a unique special skill. The rest of your character development its up to you imagination – you can even learn skills from other classes and make a very unique character build.\r\n\r\nThe game is long, challenging and very addictive. You will encounter many different enemies and a very big variety of quests and story missions. When you add great music and not-so-dated graphics you will get a full RPG experience!",

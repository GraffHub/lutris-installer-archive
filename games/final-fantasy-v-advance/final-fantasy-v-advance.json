  "description": "This version of Final Fantasy V for Game Boy Advance, also ported to iOS, has, much like Final Fantasy I and II, updated graphics and features some additional content. Not only does it have four new jobs (Gladiator, Cannoneer, Necromancer, and Oracle), but it also has a new 30-floor dungeon called the Sealed Temple and an optional boss designed by Tetsuya Nomura, Enuo. The game also has a bestiary and a music player. Quick-save is now available and some new equipment can be found.",

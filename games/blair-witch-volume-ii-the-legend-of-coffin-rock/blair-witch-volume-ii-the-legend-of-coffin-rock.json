A man without a memory, he is quickly named Lazarus by the girl's spiritualist grandmother. After Robin mysteriously disappears into the forest of the Black Hills, Lazarus is drawn into a world of human sacrifice and supernatural terror as he discovers the horrible role that the evil in the forest has in store for young Robin. With the power of Nocturne technology and gameplay that mixes adventure and fast-paced action, The Legend of Coffin Rock is a uniquely satisfying romp through hell on earth.",

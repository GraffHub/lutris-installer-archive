  "description": "Bygfoot is a football (a.k.a. soccer) management game. It is an original concept by Gyözö Both and has been improved with suggestions by players from all over the world. After Gyözö and later Mark Lawrenz left the project Ronald Sterckx took over and is currently developing and maintaining Bygfoot.\r\n\r\nBygfoot allows you to manage a team by training the players, buying and selling them, contracting loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be promoted or relegated, even become a champion if you’re a skillful manager.\r\n\r\nThe game is deliberately kept simple (though not easy): you only have to keep one eye at your players and another at your stadium.",

Once his dreams of resurrecting an ancient kingdom are realised, nobody will be spared his benevolence.\r\n\r\nIn this visual novel adventure, you must outwit zombies, genetically modified monstrosities, seductive sisters and one very sadistic secretary, in order to prevent a dark and terrifying future for mankind.

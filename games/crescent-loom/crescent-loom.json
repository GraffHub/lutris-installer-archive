  "description": "Liked the cell stage of Spore, but wanted more depth? Gotten merrily lost in the graphical programming puzzles of SpaceChem? Love the \"can I manage to build this...?\" creativity of Kerbal Space Program? \r\n\r\nCrescent Loom is the very first biologically-realistic nervous system simulation game. It lets you — in a hands-on, mad-scientist way — tinker with everything from neurotransmitter to the ecological niche of an animal.\r\n\r\nSo dive in and maybe — just maybe — by poking around with these simple creatures you'll figure something out about how your own body ticks.",

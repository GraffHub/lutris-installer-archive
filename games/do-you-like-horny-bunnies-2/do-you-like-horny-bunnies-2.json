He was indecisive about his future and unwilling to commit to her, and she thought it better to end things than to continue in a directionless relationship. Seven years have changed them both greatly. He is now a reliable man, and a master of wine selection, paid well for his talents. She has a good mind for business, is to manage the soon-to-open second branch of the famous members-only Italian restaurant, \"Platinum\". She is also married. Sumika convinces Kazuma to move back to Japan and work for her, and he can't pass the offer up.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being a top-flight restaurant, \"Platinum\" has another attraction; it is staffed by beautiful young women in bunny suits. As the bunny girls get to know Kazuma, they each begin to like him. Which of the girls will he choose? Or, can he still rekindle his old flame?\r\n\r\nDo You Like Horny Bunnies? 2 plays as a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\"-type adventure game. The story progresses at its own pace, pausing on occasion to allow you to make a decision, thus resulting in a plot branch. The game features several different endings.\r\n\r\nThe game features graphic depictions of sex, and is for adults only.",

Fortune hunting’s my game, and yours, too, if you’re daring enough to take this trip with me. Don’t be nervous; I’ll be your guide through the jungle, and I’m one of the best.\r\n\r\n“Untold riches are waiting for us there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We’ll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We’ll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We’ll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions.\r\n\r\n“So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn – and we’ll be off to seek a king’s ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures – in Pitfall Harry’s Jungle Adventure.",

  "description": "BALLYHOO\r\nLadies and gentlemen! Children of all ages! Welcome to Spangleland! A world of sawdust and glitter, buffoons and cotton candy! At least that's what you think, until you peek behind the scenes. Overhearing that the circus owner's daughter has been kidnapped, you're off to the rescue. But be careful, danger lurks in the seedy back alleys of the Big Top.\r\n\r\nIn BALLYHOO, you'll need to solve puzzles in order to solve the crime. Rather than interviewing potential suspects, you'll spend much of your time gaining access to places where the child might be hidden. Actual circus lingo and locations produce a vivid picture of life in Spangleland.\r\n\r\n    \"BALLYHOO fills yet another wing of the incredible Infocom library. For those who enjoy their visits to its hallowed halls, this is a wing they should explore.\"\r\n    -Analog Computing",

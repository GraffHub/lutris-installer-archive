  "description": "Ridge Racer is an arcade racer that puts the emphasis on speed and fun rather than on realistic driving simulation. Choose from 4 fantasy cars (plus 9 more that you must unlock yourself) and go race in a series of equally fantastical tracks against a series of computer controlled oponents as well as the clock itself.\r\n\r\nOther additions to the game come in the form of a hidden \"extra\" mode, and a music player that allows you to play any of the 6 included cd tracks as well as your own music cds.",

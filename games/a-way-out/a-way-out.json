  "description": "From the creators of Brothers – A Tale of Two Sons comes A Way Out, an exclusively co-op adventure where you play the role of one of two prisoners making their daring escape from prison.\r\n\r\nWhat begins as a thrilling breakout quickly turns into an unpredictable, emotional adventure unlike anything seen or played before.\r\n\r\nA Way Out is an experience that must be played with two players. Each player controls one of the main characters, Leo and Vincent, in a reluctant alliance to break out of prison and gain their freedom.\r\n\r\nPlay the entire experience with your friends for free using the friends pass free trial feature. When you purchase the full game, you can invite any of your friends online regardless of whether or not they’ve purchased the game. From the in-game menu, send them an invite, they’ll unlock the Free Trial, and then you’re ready to play the entire experience together.",

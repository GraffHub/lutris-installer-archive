  "description": "Rigs of Rods is an open source vehicle simulator based on soft-body physics and licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.\r\nWhat makes Rigs of Rods different to most simulators is its unique soft-body physics: vehicles, machines, objects, etc. are simulated in real-time as flexible soft-body objects, giving the simulation an extremely accurate behavior which entirely depends on the physical construction of the vehicles or objects you create.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Soft-body physics. Objects according to their weight distribution, construction, and/or suspension (in the case of vehicles).\r\n- Advanced flight model based on blade element theory. It allows the accurate simulation of any airplane, based entirely on its physical dimensions and wing airfoils, similar to X-Plane.\r\n- Accurate buoyancy model based on elemental pressure gradients, enabling boats with complex hulls to move realistically in the swell.\r\n- Basic support for dual-core processing. More multithreading and CUDA support is planned.\r\n- Basic support for scripting using AngelScript.\r\n- Based on the OGRE Graphics Engine",

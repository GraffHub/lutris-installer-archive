  "description": "The Viking Bjarni whiles his days days away in an idyllic village on Greenland’s coast until a dark prophecy knocks on his door. In his premonition, Bjarni witnesses an epic struggle between the forces of Good and Evil. He must journey to battle the Midgard Serpent. Get ready for a quest that will take you through Europe (including England and Byzantium) and the outskirts of Baghdad. Your journey will unite the four great western cultures with a common purpose. But how long can it last? Inspired by Norse mythology, the real time strategy title, Cultures 2: Gates of Asgard, combines elements of simulation, adventure, and role-playing to immerse you in Bjarni’s quest to defeat the fabled beast.",

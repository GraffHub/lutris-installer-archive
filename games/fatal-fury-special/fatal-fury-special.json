  "description": "This is a fighting game released in 1993, pitting 15 different fighters against each other. The cast includes the original eight characters from Fatal Fury 2, as well as three new characters (Billy, Axel and Laurence) and a new boss (Wolfgang Krauser). Finally, three characters from the original Fatal Fury (Duck King, Tung Fu Rue and Geese Howard) have returned to the fight. By building on the appeal from the previous game with its two-line battles, special moves, and powerful finishers, and further improving on the series' formula, this game is truly worthy of the title \"special.\" Also, if certain special conditions are met, special guest Ryo Sakazaki will make an appearance, which in itself is noteworthy.",

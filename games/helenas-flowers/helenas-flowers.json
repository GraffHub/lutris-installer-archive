  "description": "Helena of Achaea is said to be the most beautiful woman in the galaxy.\r\n\r\nAfter her elopement with the neighboring Wilusan princess, Achaea declares war on Wilusa resulting in a years-long bloody conflict. As the war is drawing to a close, Helena is escorted back to her rightful place in Achaea. However, something goes wrong and their ship crash lands on a desolate tiny planet, killing everyone on board except for Helena and a single soldier.\r\n\r\nNow stranded in the vastness of space with only a strange soldier for company, Helena finds herself thinking about what sort of fate awaits her. And more importantly, does she even have a place to return to?\r\n\r\nLoosely based on a futuristic all-female version of Homer's The Iliad, Helena's Flowers is a visual novel that explores the ideas of beauty and self-image. It was developed for the 2015 Yuri Game Jam and features 6 different endings.",

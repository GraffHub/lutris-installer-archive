Depending on your choice, you'll see a planet that rules your destiny from now on. After that you go through a variety of menus and sub-menus to learn about your life. You can discover what generally awaits you in life or simply enter an exact date and read your horoscope for it. You can check out the status of your health and your lucky items, as well as learn what kind of a person you are. Naturally, you can also add the data of another person, and see if there is a possibility of a romantic relationship between you two.",

  "description": "The presentation has been streamlined to fit the portable system's screen. Menus are clean and simple, and you're never more than a few clicks away from the next race. On the track, however, this is a full Gran Turismo experience, which means incredibly realistic handling and a connoisseur's collection of exotic cars.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 800 vehicles to race on 35 tracks, with over 70 variations. All tracks are available from the outset and winning races on them earns credits that can be spent on cars. Of course, you'll need a set of wheels to do that, so you start off with a Peugeot 206; in between each race a different set of car manufacturers will open its doors for you to add to your garage.\r\n\r\nGraphics are crisp and detailed, with vehicles in particular boasting a high level of detail. In motion, they look all the sweeter thanks to a frame rate of 60 frames per second.\r\n\r\nThe game's soundtrack is varied and a welcome feature is the ability to play your own tunes from the PSP system's Memory Stick or the built-in memory, if you're playing on PSPgo.",

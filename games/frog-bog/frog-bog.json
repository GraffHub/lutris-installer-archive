  "description": "Rival \"croakers\" wait on their lily pads for a live one. Flying critters of assorted speed and shapes float by at random, anywhere on your screen. Object of the game is to make a frog jump and catch insects with his flashing tongue. Jump your frog too far and he lands in the pond. Fun for the young and the very young at heart!",

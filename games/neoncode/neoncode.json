  "description": "Description from Itch.io:\r\n\r\n\"NeonCode is a free cyberpunk indie adventure game. The game is free, because I this a  just a hobby for me, something that I like to do. So if you like the game, Iâ€™m just simply happy about it! No ads, no lootbox, no traps. Just the game. :)\r\n\r\nThe scene is a cyberpunkish-retrowave city mixed with some noir elements. The game is mixing the open world gamestyle with some classic adventure game elements. NeonCode was inspired by films and games like Blade Runner, Miami Vice, Grim Fandango, Telltale games and many other.\r\n\r\nThe development started at November 2017, and finished at Aug 2018. I mostly worked on the game after work, so the full development time is about 250-280 hours.\"",

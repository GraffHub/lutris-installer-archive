Every other knob that gets\r\nconnected to the turned knob by wire is being marked and inherits the color of\r\nthe turned knob. After a short delay, all marked knobs are turned and trigger\r\nthe same process recursively, until there are no more marked knobs. Knobs that\r\nhave been marked multiple times will only be turned once. Then the user is able\r\nto click again. The game is won if all knobs have the same color.",

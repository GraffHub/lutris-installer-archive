  "description": "Blitzkrieg II: Fall of the Reich is an add-on for the real time strategy game Blitzkrieg 2. The player can play as either the Russians, Germans or Americans in 16 new historical missions taken from the final days of World War II's eastern front such as the Siege of Budapest and Operation Bagration. Like Blitzkrieg 2 the game features no resource gathering or unit manufacturing. You have to make do with the units you receive at the start of the game or pre-scripted reinforcements.",

  "description": "The third game in the Pang series, this game features new graphics, new digitized pseudo-3D characters, a new beginner mode, and a couple new power-ups. The characters in the game move much more fluidly than in the previous versions.\r\nEach character has a unique power. Don Tacos, the character in the sombrero, can shoot two barriers in separate places. Captain Hog, the pirate character, fires a barrier that connects to the underside of ledges or the top of the room. A new feature to the barrier is that it now has twice the power, so when a balloon hits the barrier, one of the split balloons will be instantaneously hit as well. The other two characters have features new to Pang. The pink leopard, the animal character, only can fire one barrier at a time, but has an immunity to the characters which paralyze. Shiela the Thief, the female character, shows off the new weapon, the diagonal barriers. When fired, they are sent off at a 45 degree angle in different directions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the characters, the game no longer has a world traveler theme, the setting is now an art gallery. There are wonderful digitized renditions of famous paintings in the background as you play. During the game, when all the balloons have been cleared, each character shows off a signature dance, which really shows off the great graphics. For example, Don Tacos does a dance with his maraccas.",

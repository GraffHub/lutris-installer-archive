  "description": "Rise of Flight is the most realistic WWI PC flight simulation ever created.\r\n\r\nTake to the skies of war torn Europe and experience daring air combat at the dawn of aviation. Re-enact famous air battles fought by legendary aces such as Manfred von Richtofen, James McCudden, Georges Guynemer and Eddie Rickenbacker. Rise of Flight transports you to a time when courageous pilots fought each other for control of the sky high above the bloody trenches. In aircraft made of canvas and wood they battled to the death. While some survived to become legends, most met a fiery fate. Do you have the skills and the courage to become an ACE?\r\n\r\nRise of Flight is one of the Top 100 games of All Time according to PC Gamer and it has received the Platinum Award from PC Pilot magazine and has been acknowledged multiple times by the flight-sim community at SimHQ.com and elsewhere as one of the best in the genre. You can fly in several different game modes from single-player Campaigns to massive Multiplayer dogfights. There is something for all aviation fans to enjoy.",

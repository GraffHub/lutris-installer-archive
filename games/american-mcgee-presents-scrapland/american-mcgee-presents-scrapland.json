  "description": "Scrapland is a third-person 3-D action-adventure game set in a futuristic robotic world where humans are feared and frowned upon. The game delivers a solidly engaging, sometimes humorous adventure narrative that combines a unique blend of combat and racing. Players take on the role of D-Tritus, an intergalactic traveler who finds himself involved in a series of mysterious murders committed in a world where death had been previously unheard of. With the ability to transform into any of 15 character types each with their own unique powers and the skill to pilot hundreds of gunships found in the game, D-Tritus attempts to solve this murderous conspiracy plaguing the city of Chimera. Control hundreds of ships, each with their own variation in handling depending on weight, power and aerodynamics. Create your own fleet and build customized gunships based on plans found in the game.

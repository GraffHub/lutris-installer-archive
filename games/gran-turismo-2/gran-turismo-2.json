  "description": "Could there be anything more glorious than the afterlife? Consider a lineup of over 500 of the world's most prestigious driving machines. From unrepentant speed demons to the burliest of American muscle cars. Of course, you don't drive them as much as you try to contain them. Each one is engineered according to exact specifications. You can customize them to blistering levels of performance. Sound excessive? Not considering what you're up against. Twenty of the world's most unforgiving tracks. Along with an equally merciless Rally Racing Mode. Winning won't be easy. But then, accepting defeat could be far more difficult.",

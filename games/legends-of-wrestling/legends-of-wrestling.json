  "description": "Legends of Wrestling takes one of America's most popular (fake) sports and turns back the clock. The game is all about the classic superstars including Hulk Hogan, Bret \"Hitman\" Hart, Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, Rob Van Dam, Terry Funk, The Road Warriors and George \"The Animal\" Steele.\r\n\r\nThe game features in-depth match analysis and career guidance by some of wrestling's greatest managers, including Captain Lou Albano and \"The Mouth Of The South\" Jimmy Hart. They will guide you through your career should you chose that mode of play. For those who just want to hit the mats right away, you can simply jump into an exhibition match in several match types including Tag Team Challenge, Three- and Four-Way Dances, and special guest referees.",

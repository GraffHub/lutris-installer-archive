  "description": "Arkanoid is one of the most well-known (partly very fast) Breakout variant, which can demand everything even from good players. The 32 levels consist of many rectangular blocks, that need to be destroyed by an energy ball. The Vaus capsule forms a barrier with which you hurl the ball onto the blocks. If you lose a ball, also the Vaus capsule will lose one of its 5 lives. Behind some blocks hides one of seven different extras. If the block is destroyed, an extra capsule sinks to the ground. If you catch it with the Vaus capsule, you will receive - next to points - an additional fitting, such as a wider bat or a laser. After the 32nd level follows the fight with a terminal endboss (\"Dimension Changer\") as level 33. It needs to be destroyed, to \"revive\" the destroyed mothership through a time travel.",

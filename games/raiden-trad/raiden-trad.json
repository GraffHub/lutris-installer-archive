  "description": "Mother Earth has fallen to deranged, militant aliens. As pilot of the Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter, it's up to you and you alone to mount a daring counter-attack.\r\n\r\nRip through enemy lines, torch Gatling units with your homing missiles, blast ammo-laden cargo trains with nuclear-powered bombs, and teach these galactic pirates why nobody messes with your planet.\r\n\r\nWith brilliant sound, exceptional speed and shoot-'em-up motion that showcases Jaguar's 64-Bit capabilities, Raiden is the ultimate arcade conversion for one or two players.",

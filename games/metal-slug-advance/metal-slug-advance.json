  "description": "You're a warrior of the war, but now you are alone. Enemies have captured your allied troops, and it's up to you to get them back. Armed to the teeth with firearms, grenades and specially made \"Slug\" vehicles, you must travel across the levels and blast anything in sight that isn't a friendly.\r\n\r\nTwo characters are offered to play as, and along with the usual Metal Slug flair visually, and epic battle sequences against strange and startling foes, you can now collect special E-cards during the game. Saved allies will hand you these cards that, when brought back to camp, can increase ammo, power and many more improvements to alter the gameplay experience.",

Hurl your soul from one totem to another in search of the memories of lost souls. Manipulate the environment to progress, but beware of disrupting the balance of light and darkness...\r\n\r\nAnnwn is an abstract stealth strategy game of tension and relief, across a series of mysterious procedural islands.",

  "description": "FreezeME is a 3D platformer in the style of the 90s-era but wait there is a twist! The main character “R” has one special tool – a camera around her neck. This camera allows her to literally freeze the objects she photographs.\r\n\r\nThis brown-eyed moppet with a camera around her neck is hot on the trail of her best friend, “M“, who has been abducted by the dastardly Fat the Cat that longs to create what he describes as a “Dog-Free-World”. How kidnapping M will help him with this goal remains something of a mystery, but R is determined to thwart him by rescuing M from his clutches.",

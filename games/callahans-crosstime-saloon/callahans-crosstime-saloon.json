  "description": "The gods have decided that it’s closing time for our universe, so the regulars at Callahan’s Crosstime Saloon can either drink up and go home, or do something about it. But Callahan’s is no ordinary neighborhood bar. Think of it as a cross between Cheers and the Star Wars cantina – it’s the place where every being knows your name, even if you’re from another time or another universe. Time travelers, aliens, vampires, ordinary folks, and even a talking dog – it’s an odd cast of characters, but somebody’s got to save the universe and it might as well be you!",

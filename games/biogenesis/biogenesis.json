  "description": "Welcome to this modern microbiology laboratory called Biogenesis!\r\n\r\nIt's quite easy here to experiment with a huge variety of our organisms and study their life and behavior. Just take a seat, prepare your microscope and test tubes and enjoy the colorful evolution of life.\r\n\r\nStudy your favorite beings and clone them. Check the ecosystem stability by stimulating the growth of a concrete species or eradicating another one. Be the first one to discover a new life pathway or freeze an interesting organism to share it with your colleagues. Be fascinated by the different ways evolution can take and play with different parameters to see how organisms mutate to adapt to the environment.",

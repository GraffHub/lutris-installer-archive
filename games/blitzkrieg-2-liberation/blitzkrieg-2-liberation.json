  "description": "Blitzkrieg 2: Liberation is the second official expansion pack for the World War II themed real time strategy game Blitzkrieg 2. The game aims at the more hardcore fans by offering more difficult scenarios in its two included new campaigns. An Allied campaign offers missions in Italy, while the Axis campaign focuses on their retreat of France. Like its predecessor the game features no resource management or unit construction. You have to make do with the units you receive at the start of the level and sporadic reinforcements. Mostly everything in the maps can be used for cover or destroyed when confronted with enough firepower.",

  "description": "You're piloting a helicopter gunship, flying cover for a truck convoy of medical supplies through enemy territory. Suddenly, y our long-range scanner shows squadrons of enemy aircraft closing in on your position.\r\n\r\nYou through the control stick forward and your chopper shoots skyward, barely avoiding a cluster of multi-warhead missiles. Your response is swift, as you pivot your gunship 180ยบ, unleashing a lightning barrage of laser rockets.\r\n\r\nThe action: furious. The concentration: intense. You are engaged in one of the most demanding video battles ever conceived. You must rely on your long-range scanner, your wits, and your reflexes. Because it's your responsibility to see that those supplies get through.\r\n\r\nSo, take charge--you're at the controls, with Chopper Command by ACTIVISION.",

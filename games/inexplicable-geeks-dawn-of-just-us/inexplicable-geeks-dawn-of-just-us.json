  "description": "Enter a world of superheroes. Kind of.\r\n\r\nThe 20th Anniversary of the Age of Super Geeks has hit, and as a mild-mannered reporter, it is your duty to head on down to the local convention center and get the big scoop! Only, you're probably the only reporter there, as a Super Geek isn't as flashy as a Super Hero. You see, the difference between the two is.... one can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and one.... can tie your shoelaces with just their mind.\r\n\r\nSo, yeah, it's not the most flashy job to chase.\r\n\r\nWe wouldn't be as bold as to say that it's like playing an interactive Christopher Guest film, but that's exactly what it is like.",

  "description": "This 'Prince of Darkness' has taken away the Golden Axe and put an evil curse over all the warriors. However, one of the heroes has their curse relieved and is sent to set things straight - lift curse off others, defeat the villian and return with the Golden Axe.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay has been expanded slightly, but is essentially the same hack n' slash as the previous games. New features to the series include new characters, new moves and junction points where you can choose which path to take.",

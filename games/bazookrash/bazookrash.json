  "description": "Bazookrash is the story of another sleepless night for Morlando, who tired of the noise of the patrol cars in his neighborhood decides to grab his bazooka and two more weapons to unleash hell. Here's how you play!\r\n\r\nDestroy all pink and flashy fish-cars making sure you don't miss too many of them or take down the civilian ones (blue). Your goal is increasing your sleep gauge by killing the noise and avoiding insomnia again.\r\n\r\nLink several attacks for a better score and try to make it until dawn, following the crescendo rhythm of Ravel's masterpiece Bolero.\r\n\r\nBazookrash cars are randomly generated making each round unique, like real noisy nights. This is a short, 7 minute game perfect for our busy lives that will assist you in blowing off some steam and increasing your FPS skills the more you play it.",

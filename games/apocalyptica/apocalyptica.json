  "description": "The forces of good and evil collide in this third-person gothic science fiction shooter.\r\n\r\nThe single-player mode lets players select one of 16 characters and lead a team of holy avengers against the forces of Neo-Satan. Characters are skill rated and armed with guns, swords, and spells. Although the teammates and opponents are bots, each of the 18 levels is an objective based mission typical of multiplayer FPS games (rescue hostages, deliver packages, etc...). The player and bots re-spawn an unlimited number of times until the level objective is completed or failed. The forces of evil usually have a numerical advantage including a team of character type bots (comparable to the player's team) and an additional horde of mindless minions.\r\n\r\nBecause the campaign is essentially a bot filled multiplayer game, the multiplayer is virtually identical to the single player game except with human opponents and the opportunity to play as the evil characters.",

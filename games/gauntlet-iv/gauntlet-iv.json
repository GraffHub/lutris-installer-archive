  "description": "The Genesis/Mega Drive version, which was titled Gauntlet in Japan and released in North America and Europe as Gauntlet IV, features a totally original soundtrack and three new game modes in addition to an arcade mode which is a port of the original game:\r\n\r\n    Quest Mode – A story mode where the player must defeat the four towers and solve the mystery of the ancient castle; weapons can be bought with collected gold from merchants in the main hub area, where one can also choose which tower to take on next. The player can gain experience points to increase their character's stats and passwords can be used to continue.\r\n    Battle Mode – Where multiple players fight against each other to the death. Maps can include teleporters/monsters/items etc. Players who go into exits are eliminated from the round.\r\n    Record Mode – A single-player variation of the Arcade Mode with some variations such as using passwords to continue. The player character cannot die in this mode, although points are subtracted for every 500 health points lost.",

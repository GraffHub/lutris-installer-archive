  "description": "Dinothawr is a simple puzzle game made by Agnes Heyer and Hans-Kristian Arntzen AKA Themaister (original creator of the RetroArch/libretro project).\r\n\r\nThe goal of the game is to save your frozen friends by pushing them onto lava so they can thaw. It mixes gameplay mechanics from Kickle Cubicle and Sokoban with some lovely ambient homegrown music.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* 50+ levels\r\n* Level editor\r\n* Shaders for enhanced graphics, and/or plain retro graphics for pixel purists\r\n\r\nThis game comes with a customized standalone version of RetroArch serving as the frontend. This is the first game based solely around the libretro API.\r\n\r\nLike libretro/RetroArch, the game is open source and its source can be obtained on Github.",

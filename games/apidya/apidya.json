You are Ikuro and you are the only one who can commit the neccessary deeds - live off your wits, live off your instinct, but above all, life off your sacred love for Yuri.\r\n\r\nAs the ancient talisman transforms you into a beautiful bee, such beauty is darkened by the burning passion to hurt, maim and destroy Hexaa and his evil army of insects and wildlife. Your insect bite is deadly.... but are you?",

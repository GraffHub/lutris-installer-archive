  "description": "A tale of Orwellian horror, humor, and suspense, programmed and designed by Dave, Barry, and Dee Dee Murphy, authors of The Ancient Art of War and The Ancient Art of War at Sea.\r\n\r\nA foreboding vision of our planet's future, Manhunter: New York evolves around the life of a detective in New York City two years after alien invasion and consequent world takeover. Contracted by the newly founded alien dictatorship, the detective's goal is to track human activities, monitor their movements and report subversive activities.\r\n\r\nManhunter: New York, a twist on contemporary adventure games, allows players to choose allegiance between good and evil as the story progresses. Make critical decisions which may change the outcome of the game.\r\n\r\nTrack human activities using an authentic map of New York City and a personal mini-computer which aids you in your quest. Travel through haunting locations that are replicas of a post-holocaust Manhattan. Meet characters that are more dubious than any you've ever met in a Sierra adventure.",

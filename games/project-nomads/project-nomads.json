  "description": "Project Nomads leads you into a very strange futuristic world. Your planet is destroyed, and all that's left are thousands of small islands, floating around. One of those small islands is yours. You can navigate through the world with it, build gun turrets, windmills, storage-silos, etc.\r\n\r\nProject Nomads is a very stylish genre-mix. You have to manage your island (strategy), fight against a lot of enemies from your different turrets (arcade), walk around, cast spells (jump 'n' run) or even jump into a fighter or bomber and attack the enemies islands and units (action-sim).",

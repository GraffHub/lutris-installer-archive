  "description": "Hyperdrive Massacre is an 80s inspired local multiplayer frag-fest for up to 4 players. Players take control of a space Cadillac and frag their way to victory against friends or can also play against AI. Both modes allow players to unlock a full crew roster. Sub-machine guns, sniper rifles, frag grenades, homing missiles and bullet deflectors are just some of the tools player can use to create havoc.\r\n\r\nNote: This Game Requires A Controller.\r\nHyperdrive Massacre is best played on a couch. Although its content is family-friendly, it also makes for an excellent drinking game.",

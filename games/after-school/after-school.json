  "description": "Every evening, as she walks back from school, a Japanese girl\r\nstops at the window of the boy she loves in secret.\r\nBut he only has eyes for his books and doesn't notice her.\r\nThe girl dreams of the day she will find the strength to talk to him. \r\n\r\nAFTER SCHOOL is a short videogame entirely handpainted on paper, using pencils and watercolors. It's a collaboration between students in Game Art at ECV Bordeaux (backgrounds, characters & animations) and Atelier Sent√¥ (story, music & programming). It was done in 2 days during a masterclass.",

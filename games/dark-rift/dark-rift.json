  "description": "Dark Rift brings out the best in people. Eve works her butt off to turn Gore into a meaty pin cushion. Gore busts his gut to move Eve into the path of his axe. And you'll need your best, because Dark Rift gives it up. Dark Rift delivers more fight, more often with more speed than you have ever seen before. Check out Dark Rift for N64 or Win 95 and get flesh scorching projectiles, hyper quick ten hit combos, blazing frame rates and some very unpleasant surprises for the competition.",

In the game, you, the diver, must get around an octopus whom is trying to capture you and get to the treasure. When Mr. Game & Watch returns to the salvage ship, he gets three extra points. The player's three chances are measured by extra divers on the savage ship. When one is attacked by the Octopus' tentacles, another takes his place.",

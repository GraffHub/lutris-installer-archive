  "description": "All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. was a promotional item given out as a contest prize by the Japanese radio show All Night Nippon to celebrate its twentieth year on the air. It is mainly a graphical hack of Super Mario Bros. (although a handful of levels are from Super Mario Bros. 2.) Some of the games sprites have been changed to look like famous Japanese celebrities and other people related to the All-Night Nippon program.",

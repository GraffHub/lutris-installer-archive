  "description": "Capcom Sports Club is a multi-event sports game for one or two players who can choose to play any one of three different sports games: Tennis (Smash Stars), Football (Kick Stars) and Basketball (Dunk Stars).\r\n\r\nThe game's look and feel is typical of Capcom's output of the time and is skewed heavily towards fast, cartoon-like arcade action.\r\n\r\nOf the three games on offer, \"Smash Stars\" Tennis is by far the most accomplished and would easily stand up as an arcade machine in its own right.",

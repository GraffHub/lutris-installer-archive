A routine job for a crack Special Forces team, right? Besides, the island looks deserted. . .\r\n\r\nFrom the creators of the Resident Evil series, Dino Crisis contains all the suspense and mounting sense of fear you would expect as you try to second-guess a horde of dinosaurs running rampage across a ravaged isle, with stunning real-time graphics as sharp as a raptor's big toe!\r\n\r\nInjuries can leave trails of blood, a delicious starter for your ravenous foes, so use the scattered medical supplies wisely, or you may become the main course...\r\n\r\nJurassic Shock. Not for the squeamish.",

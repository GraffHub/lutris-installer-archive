  "description": "NationStates is a nation simulation game. Create a nation according to your political ideals and care for its people. Or deliberately oppress them. It's up to you.\r\nA promotional device for the novel Jennifer Government, NationStates allows a player to enjoy a very lightweight governance simulator and arbitrate government positions on various issues that come up; compounding these policy decisions with an initial survey of the governor's political beliefs results in an ever-shifting status (slightly adjusted with every new decision that comes through the pipe). Players compete with each other, both regionally and globally, to see whose country ranks more extremely on various political metrics.",

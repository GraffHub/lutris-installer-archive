  "description": "Summary:\r\n\"Flying Corps Gold is a great change of pace from the mach 2 action of more modern combat flight sims, and flying the vintage aircraft is a whole different challenge than jetting around in fly-by-wire planes like the F-22 and F-16. Flying Corps Gold is the best World War I era flight sim to hit the skies in quite some time. You'll spend hours flying, dogfighting, and bombing enemy ground targets. \"--Adrenaline Vault\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nAstounding 3D high resolution landscapes in 16-bit color using DirectX.\r\nFrame rates in excess of 30fps are possible.\r\nWindows 95 Mission Editor fully featured.\r\nCustomize the paint schemes on your squadron's aircraft.\r\nLandscape recreated in minute detail from archive material.\r\nEnhanced view system including a new peripheral view mode.\r\nSupports the CH Products Force FX stick - makes play more realistic and dynamic.\r\nSingle or multiplayer option including modem, direct connect, network and Wireplay for up to 8 players.",

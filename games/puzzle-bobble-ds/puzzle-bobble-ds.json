  "description": "The long-running series known as Bust-a-Move in America and Puzzle Bobble in Japan makes its mark on the Nintendo DS. The rules are unchanged as you attempt to line up at least three like colors, but the DS, as expected, allows for full stylus-based controls. In two player mode, the top screen shows your opponent's game screen. Although Puzzle Bobble is known as Bust-A-Move in North America and a DS edition of the series was released the same year as this game, the two are entirely different -- for the North American edition, new controls and entirely overhauled multiplayer components were added, making for a brand new game.",

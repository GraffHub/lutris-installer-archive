  "description": "Unforgiving and tense, each mission tells a story of two police operatives - John Rimes and Rick Jones, filled with infiltrating gang hideouts, rescuing hostages, making arrests and other life-threatening situations.\r\n\r\n> The Surrender System allows you to apprehend the suspects without resorting to violence. Fire a warning shot near them or engage them in melee combat - those are just some of the ways you can make them submit.\r\n> Issue commands to your fellow cop Rick Jones. Make sure to use him wisely - and who knows, he might save your life in return.\r\n> Randomly placed criminals, hostages and evidence make every level run unique. The placement changes every time you restart, leading to new interesting situations and opportunities.\r\n> As a law enforcement officer, you will have access to end-of-the-line police equipment, such as under-the-door cameras, door blast charges and many others.\r\n> Various types of lawbreakers, from small petty criminals to well organised gangs and terrorists. Each type has not only unique weapons, but different behaviour and shooting skill.\r\n> Complex Tactical Gameplay: Try not to get spotted, don't waste bullets, regularly check your surroundings and make sure to take criminals down quietly.\r\n> All your actions are scored in real time. Playing aggressively won't get you a high enough result to start the next mission - so keep that in mind!\r\n> Online Co-op. Complete missions in multiplayer for better scores and more fun!",

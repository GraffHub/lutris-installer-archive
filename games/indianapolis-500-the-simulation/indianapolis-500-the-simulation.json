  "description": "The greatest spectacle in racing is now the greatest racing simulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's the greatest Race Course in the World(r). That's why a half-million spectators are here. That's why the world's best drivers are here. That's why you're here.\r\n\r\nThe Race: Indy(r) -- the most demanding competition in motor sports. Qualify for the pole position and you have the advantage, but you'll still have to face 32 of the best drivers in the world. They're all determined to claim the checkered flag.\r\n\r\nThe Experience: At 220+ miles per hour, your car is more aircraft than automobile. Keep all your rubber on th etrack for a 25 mile sprite or the full 500. Precise control and flowless concentration are required. One wrong move can cost you the race.\r\n\r\nThe Tradition: For three-quarters of a century, people from all over the world have converged on the Indianapolis Moter Speedway each May. And the \"Brickyard\"(tm) has been the proving ground for innovations in automobile technology since the invention of the car. Now you can participate in the Indianapolis 500(r), America's greatest racing tradition.\r\n\r\nThe Realism:\r\n\r\n    3-D graphics for stunning realism\r\n    Instant Replays from six different camera angles to capture daring passes and devastating mistakes\r\n    Full pit lane\r\n    Choose from one of three different cars or tune your own with 8 suspension and chassis adjustments\r\n    Save up to 3 custom car configurations",

  "description": "Flower is a game that imagines what a flower's dream would be like.\r\n\r\nThe game starts in a dull grey room, with a wilted flower in a pot on a table. The player can use the Sixaxis to zoom in on the flower, and presses a button to start the dream. Now the player finds themselves on a meadow, where they control a petal, steered by the wind, that has to bloom other flowers by flying close to them.\r\n\r\nFrom each flower the player got to bloom, an additional petal joins, creating a long string of colourful petals moving through the air. Once the colour has been restored to the meadow, the player returns to the initial room and can choose a new flower's dream.",

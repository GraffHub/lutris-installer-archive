  "description": "My Disney Kitchen is a cooking game where you are neighbors with Mickey and Minnie. They will come to your house to eat food, comment on the radio station, look at the decorated kitchen etc. There are many tools you can use to make food and lots of food to work with. You simply cook and decorate your own kitchen with Mickey and Minnie helping you. You can call them and sometimes they will give you tips on how to make things like applesauce and smoothies. They will also give you ingredients if you run out. There are real life recipes from Family Fun magazine that you can make in your own kitchen.\r\n\r\nMickey and Minnie won't eat everything you make. There are two stars on the oven and counter in your kitchen to make cake and breakfast for the two of them. In the Good Morning Griddle section, you can make eggs, bacon, and pancakes for Mickey and Minnie. You have to put them on the griddle and flip them over when needed. You can also put maple syrup and butter on them for flavor. In Bake-A-Cake, you can bake, mix, frost, and decorate a cake for Mickey and Minnie. You can save the game on your memory card or on your computer depending on what version you are playing. You can also watch demos, where you can learn to make meals.",

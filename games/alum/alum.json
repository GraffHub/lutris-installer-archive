  "description": "Guide Alum on his spiritual journey through the dangerous, icy, \"Land of Tide\". Help him discover the truth about his city, Kosmos, and the mysterious epidemic known as \"The Vague\". As the tale unfolds, it will keep you enthralled all the way up to its epic conclusion. \r\n\r\nAlum is an original point-and-click adventure game. It has the nostalgic feel of classics (90's Lucasarts, Sierra games) mixed with modern game-play elements and pacing that caters more towards this generation. The world, story, and characters lean towards a RPG-esque style, while the game-play mechanics and puzzles stay true to the classic point-and-click genre.",

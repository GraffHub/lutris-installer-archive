  "description": "You play as a skater on the brink of life and death collecting aesthetics to reach enlightenment in skate-purgatory whilst trying to expiate your sins, help lost souls, find meaning in life and closure in death. A vaporwave experience.\r\n\r\nSKATE EVERYTHING\r\n\r\nYou can literally skate whatever surface you want, kind of like that one city scene in INCEPTION. The game's control scheme is simple and accessible for everyone while also offering the depth to those who want to line up and flick dank tricks whilst controlling their board midair.\r\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK\r\n\r\nA game where you can just skate without even worrying about the objectives and listen to the amazing lineup of songs with the in-game player driven radio from over 25 artists while taking in the open world skate map full of intentional and unintentional great skate spots to discover.",

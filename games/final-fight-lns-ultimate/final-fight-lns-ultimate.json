  "description": "Final Fight LNS Ultimate mixes concepts and movements from both beat'em-ups  and fighting games. It has a revolutionary and innovative warping system based on \"canceling\", which allows you to link special movements with others, thus making massive combos. The game is also designed so that its difficulty decreases considerably as you learn and execute this system, so the learning curve can be steep. In other words, the game will reward you as you learn to deal as much damage as possible to the targets. The playable character roster consists of 69 characters combining fighters from several of Capcom's most successful games including: Final Fight, Street Fighter, Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, Captain Commando, Alien vs Predator, Battle Circuit, Darkstalkers, Marvel vs Capcom and Strider.",

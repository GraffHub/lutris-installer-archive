  "description": "Gameplay Football is my attempt to bring back some of the charm of the era of the more 'direct' footy game. The current downloadable version is Public Beta 2, in which you can play matches against the CPU or with/against friends. Using a gamepad is highly recommended (but not mandatory). Since it's a beta, there may be bugs, but it should be pretty playable. If you encounter a game-breaking bug (crashes and such), please report this in the forums! ",

  "description": "San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP) is a modification for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas which turns it into a multiplayer game. You can play over the internet (or LAN) with up to 999 other people (having up to 1,000 players online at once). You need the original Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas PC game to play San Andreas Multiplayer.\r\n\r\nIn SA:MP you are able to do almost anything that you can do in single player GTA. SA:MP also features the ability to create your own scripted game modes. There are many game modes that feature a series of different and fun things to do. Many of which are not possible in single player.",

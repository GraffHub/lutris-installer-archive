  "description": "AssaultCube Reloaded, formerly AssaultCube Special Edition, is a free-and-open-source first-person-shooter, created by the AssaultCube Reloaded Task Force to improve AssaultCube.\r\n\r\nThis game combines the best of all worlds: realism from Battlefield, “anti-cheat” inspired by the Quake engine, perks from Call of Duty, mutators from Red Eclipse, and fast-paced gameplay with a low system footprint from AssaultCube and the Cube Engine.\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the numerous improvements compared to AssaultCube:\r\n*    New, diverse game modes and mutators\r\n*    Many new and different weapons\r\n*    More realistic gameplay (damage fading over distance, bleeding, drowning)\r\n*    Less potential cheats (by moving more code to the server)\r\n*    Better voting system: admin votes don’t veto directly\r\n*    Improved radar shows explosions and shotlines\r\n*    Killfeed makes it easy to see how players were killed\r\n*    Spawn enqueue/dequeue—no need to spam the spawn button",

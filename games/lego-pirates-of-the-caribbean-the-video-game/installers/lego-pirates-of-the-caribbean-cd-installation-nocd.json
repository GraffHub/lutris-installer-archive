  "description": "This installer is for the DVD released 2011. The CD is only needed for installation. A NoCDfix will be downloaded so the game can be played without the cd in the drive. This installer should make it easy to use every gamepad to play together or alone.",
  "notes": "If you're installer seems to be crashed don't close it, it just doesn't respond when its copying files.\r\nDepending on your gamepad you have to either deactivate the *(event) or *(js) device in the joystick control panel.(You have to try which)",

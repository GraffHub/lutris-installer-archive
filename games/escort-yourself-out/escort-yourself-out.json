  "description": "Escort Yourself Out is an escort-mission-style game in which you are asked to help your childhood self navigate triggering environments. While moving through everyday spaces fraught with triggers, you must take action to care for yourself in order to navigate the situation. It is an autobiographical representation of some of my experiences being mentally ill.\r\n\r\nEverybody experiences mental illness and trauma differently. This game is representative of some of my experiences, and no one else's. I make no claim to represent a universal experience of mental illness or trauma, but, rather, just one manifestation of these things.",

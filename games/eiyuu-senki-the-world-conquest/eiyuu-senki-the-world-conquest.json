  "description": "In a world where powerful nations run rampant and heroes battle one another for supremacy, the great nation of Britannia seeks to unite the world through peaceful means while the European Union has adopted an aggressive policy and the seafaring nation of Vinland thrives of pillage and plunder. Far in the east, the small nation of Zipang is struck fast in a quagmire of civil unrest.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, our memory-loss stricken main character has a fateful meeting with a Hero of Yamatai, Himiko. Together they settle Zipang's  internal disputes and set off into a world covered with the burning embers of war.",

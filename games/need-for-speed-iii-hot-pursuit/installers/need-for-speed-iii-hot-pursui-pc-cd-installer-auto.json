  "notes": "After setup, first game launch is a black screen. Close the game and wine and rerun the game. \r\n\r\nthis is a forced version from the original PC CD Installer:\r\n\r\nI couldn't make the game itself run (only the launcher), but I thought maybe this works for others as it has good ratings on winehq\r\n\r\non the winehq page there is an additional dll patch for higher resolutions https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=1903&iTestingId=75112\r\n\r\nYou will have to mount the CD as loop device on some folder or keep the CD in while playing the game due to DRM",

  "description": "What better way to spend an evening than gathered around listening to a classic tale of a brave hero saving a princess from a sinister demon lord bent on ruling the world? Sure, it may be the same story you've heard time and time again, but don't old stories get better with age? \r\n\r\nSo here we find our usual crew. A hero, a demon lord, and a princess all congregating to tell the story of the hero's triumph and the defeat of a great evil. Everyone here know their role and exactly how to carry it out. But what happens when the story doesn't go exactly as we know it? What if someone were to rewrite the story to something no one within it knows how to enact? Who's responsibility is it to put the story back on its track and find the happy ending we all know and love? \r\n\r\n...Wait, didn't we do this once before? \r\n\r\nWell, let's do it again, and we'll make it bigger and better this time! \r\n\r\nHere Comes Brave Hero Yuusha EX!",

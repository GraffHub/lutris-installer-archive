  "description": "Farming Simulator 15 is the 2015 edition of the farming simulation series. It largely continues the gameplay from the previous games in a sandbox environment. Players start with a small farm and by managing it efficiently the scope can be expanded while profits bring in new and better gear such as powerful tractors, harvesters and high capacity trailers. As in the previous games almost every action, such as connecting attachments, sowing, fertilization, plowing, harvesting, taking produce to the market and feeding animals need to be done manually. Two new types of activities for this release are animal husbandry and forestry, but at a high starting cost. For forestry players can plant and cut down trees. The wood can be sold to a lumber mill and wood chippings to a heating plant. Many new types of vehicles and machines are introduced for this activity.",

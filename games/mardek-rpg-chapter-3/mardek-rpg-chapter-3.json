  "description": "The third chapter in the story of MARDEK. Mardek is now a Royal Knight, who's sent on various missions for the King. Of course, things aren't that simple... And Rohoph's still alive; the Governance de Magi can't be havin' with that.\r\n\r\nChapter 3 includes oodles more party members, and less linear gameplay. Exciting.\r\nIt took forever to make - three years! - because I recoded the engine from scratch, which took a while and many failed attempts, and removed a lot of enthusiasm that I had for the game.\r\n\r\nThis chapter contains 40+ hours of gameplay, and includes remade versions of the first two chapters.

  "description": "Pitfall! is a platform action game. You play Pitfall Harry who is on a quest to locate treasure deep in the jungle. With a little luck you'll be able to find money bags, silver bars, gold bars, and diamond rings. But many obstacles will get in the way, some of which merely deduct points from your score, while others are fatal. Rolling logs and falling down a hole will deduct points, and scorpions, alligators, snakes, bottomless pits, swamps, and fires will cause Pitfall Harry to lose a life. You have 20 minutes to try to collect all of the treasures on the numerous screens, if you can live that long!\r\n\r\n”Let me introduce myself. I’m Pitfall Harry, veteran jungle explorer. Fortune hunting’s my game, and yours, too, if you’re daring enough to take this trip with me. Don’t be nervous; I’ll be your guide through the jungle, and I’m one of the best.\r\n\r\n“Untold riches are waiting for us there, but so are dangers a dozen times over. We’ll be swinging on vines over bottomless tarpits. We’ll be hopping across swamps, using crocodile heads like stepping stones. We’ll be searching underground through dark passageways crawling with killer scorpions.\r\n\r\n“So pack up your backpack and meet me at the jungle at dawn – and we’ll be off to seek a king’s ransom in gold, diamonds and lost treasures – in Pitfall Harry’s Jungle Adventure.

And they may revolt! After the revolution discontent people become happy and give bonus to production.\r\n\r\nProduction\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the game you will have 2 resources: gold and food. Gold is necessary for buying new buildings and for hiring citizens. Food is necessary for the hiring of citizens, while, unlike gold, for each citizen, only one food unit is needed. You need to decide when you are ready to start hiring more expensive citizens, because they require as much food as cheap ones.\r\n\r\nDiscontent and happiness\r\n\r\nWhen there are too many citizens, they become discontent. Discontent citizens can arrange a revolution. After the revolution, discontent citizens will become happy and they will receive a bonus to gold production. The revolutions of citizens are independent, if the revolution was arranged by the peasants, only the peasants will be happy after it. Decide who should start the revolution, because after the revolution the game starts anew!\r\n\r\nFurther progress\r\n\r\nWith the construction of new buildings you will discover animals, magic, army and battles with monsters, assimilation of other races and much more.",

Guide and develop your faithful disciples in turn-based conflict to convert worshippers away from rival gods. Become the most powerful god of all!\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n– Create your own religion: From peaceful meditative monks to savage warrior-priests drenched in the blood of human sacrifice, mix and match dozens of religious dogmas to shape your worshippers’ morality!\r\n\r\n– Guide your disciples: Disciples are the heroes of your religion. They require your guidance—choose their class and level up their abilities to create your perfect team of mighty missionaries.\r\n\r\n– Manage your holy site: Your worshippers expand your holy site with new temples and buildings based on the religion you’ve created.

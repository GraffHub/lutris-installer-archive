  "description": "Close Your Eyes is a puzzle horror game where your only defense against enemies is to close your eyes. Enemies will not chase you while your eyes are closed. You are being hunted down in an eerie research facility with a backstory shrouded in mystery. The creatures that roam in this facility are tenacious and ruthless. Remember, if you can't see them, they can't see you.\r\n\r\nYou can't outrun them. You can't hide from them. Your only option is to close your eyes.",

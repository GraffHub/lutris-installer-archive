  "description": "You are a mercenary possessed by a flame demon in a desperate world ravaged by seven Ice Lords and their Dead-Army. \r\n\r\nIn this RPG where all your choices lead to consequences, you will have to choose between unleashing the powers of the beast within and rejecting the demonic influence that wants to claim your humanity.\r\n\r\nFreely develop your abilities and combat style through three skill trees: swing the heavy weapons of the Fighter, wield the sneaky dual daggers of the Ranger, or use the devastating flame spells of the Pyromancer.\r\n\r\nRecruit companions who will live, love, hate and fight alongside you against the dreadful creatures of Vertiel, in real-time epic battles based on tactics and reaction.\r\n\r\nThe bigger the danger, the greater the temptation to draw on the demon’s power at the cost of your soul… which way will YOU choose?",

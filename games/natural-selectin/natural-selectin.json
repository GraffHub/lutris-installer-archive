  "description": "Natural Selection blends first-person combat with real-time strategy. It features intense “marines vs. aliens” teamplay, where one marine can become Commander. The Commander plays from a top-down perspective and leads live players.\r\n\r\nThe aliens can evolve upgrades like “Cloaking” and “Scent of Fear”, and can change lifeforms to run on walls, fly, and even devour marines whole.\r\n\r\nNS has atmospheric indoor sci-fi environments full of steam and smoke, and features custom orchestral music from the award-winning Jeremy Soule.\r\n\r\nIt is a freely-available Half-life modification, and since its release in October of 2002, has had over 2 million downloads, and had been played for 2 billion player-minutes.",

Ever had to fend for yourself in the face of strangely hypnotic music, alien doctors, talking computers a-plenty and half-finished bathrooms? Ever found something unpleasant in a burger?\r\n\r\nIf so, Out Of Order should play like any other day in your life.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, it's an experience not to be missed.\r\n",

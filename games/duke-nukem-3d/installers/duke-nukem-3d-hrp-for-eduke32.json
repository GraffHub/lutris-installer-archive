  "notes": "- This script will not install \"Duke Nukem 3D\" nor EDuke32, it will only install Hi Resolution Packs provided by http://hrp.duke4.net/ and the \"Duke Nukem 3D\" community. So you have to install one of this scripts \"Steam + EDuke32\", \"All versions + EDuke32\" or \"GOG + EDuke32\" before this one.\r\n- Please report issue concerning this script on my Github page:\r\nhttps://github.com/legluondunet/MyLittleLutrisScripts/",

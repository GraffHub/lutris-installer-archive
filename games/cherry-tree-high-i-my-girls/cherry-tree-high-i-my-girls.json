  "description": "Cherry Tree High I! My! Girls! is the sequel to the popular slice-of-life adventure game Cherry Tree High Comedy Club by developer 773, and picks up the story where Cherry Tree High Comedy Club left off, but this time as a kinetic (single story branch) visual novel and adds new areas, new music, and three new characters to the roster!\r\n\r\nNow that Mairu and friends have successfully re-opened the club, they actually need to act like a club! Mairu’s nemesis Chitose hasn’t given up on closing them down just yet, so they’ll need to be careful! But Chitose isn’t the only problem that Mairu and friends have to face... A rival club is competing for the spot of number one entertainment club, and a new transfer student will forever affect the Comedy Club line-up!",

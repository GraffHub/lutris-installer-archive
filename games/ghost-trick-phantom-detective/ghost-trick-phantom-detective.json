Ghost Trick's story centers on the recently deceased protagonist Sissel, and his ghost's struggle to discover who he was when he was alive and who killed him. The player assumes the role of this ghost, who has the ability to perform various Ghost Tricks to solve puzzles and navigate the world around him.\r\n\r\nThe lead development was handled by Shu Takumi, creator of the Ace Attorney franchise. The game is published by Capcom and was released for the Nintendo DS in Japan on June 19, 2010; in North America on January 11, 2011; in Europe on January 14, 2011; and in Australia on January 20, 2011. A version for iOS was released in Japan on December 16, 2010 and the rest of the world on February 2, 2012.\r\n\r\nThe game starts with a spirit coming to consciousness with no memories of his past except his name, Sissel. He sees a corpse of a man on the ground in a junkyard, and believes he just recently died. Another spirit named Ray tells Sissel about the nature of spirits, including the ability to inhabit objects and manipulate them as \"ghost tricks\". Ray also tells Sissel that he can use ghost tricks to go back four minutes before the death of a person and attempt to save their life. Sissel does so to save the life of Lynne, a young detective, from an assassin. Sissel learns Lynne had come to the junkyard to get information from him, and decides to follow her to recover his memories. Ray warns that Sissel's spirit will dissipate at dawn.",

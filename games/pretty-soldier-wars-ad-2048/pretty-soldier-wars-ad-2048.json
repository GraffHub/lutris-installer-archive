  "description": "The world has been devastated by The Third, an apocalyptic event that occurred decades ago as a result of mankind's avarice sent the world to war. As armies embraced both biological and nuclear weapons, killing millions, the real horror came later. The Yoju â€“ monsters spawned from the mutated remains of biological agents that feed on the dead inside the radioactive fallout. The resulting horrific mutations bred in the bodies of humans, covering the blighted landscape and pushing humanity to the brink of extinction.\r\n\r\n It is now the year 2048. As mankind's final gamble in their struggle against the Yoju, a squad of genetically engineered cyborg soldiers was created. Its members possess combat ability far beyond that of normal humans and have been programmed with the complete database of anti-Yoju strategies and tactics, providing them all highest tactical advantages possible. These female soldiers have become humanity's last line of defense against total annihilation. They're called the A.S.S.P., humanity's last hope.",

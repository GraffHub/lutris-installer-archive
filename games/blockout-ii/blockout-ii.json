  "description": "BlockOut速 II is a free adaptation of the original BlockOut速 DOS game edited by California Dreams in 1989. BlockOut速 II has the same features than the original game with few graphic improvements. The game has been designed to reproduce the original game kinematics as accurately as possible. The score calculation is also nearly similar to the original.\r\nBlockOut速 II also features an online score database where you can upload your high-scores with their replays and get various statistics. The score registering system also includes an efficient fake score detection.",

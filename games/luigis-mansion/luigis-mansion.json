Gadd between stages. \r\nIn each stage, players control Luigi as he explores the mansion's rooms and hunts down the ghosts that lay within them, acquiring keys to get through locked doors and eventually dealing with a boss ghost hidden at the end of the stage, with more rooms becoming accessible as each stage is completed.",

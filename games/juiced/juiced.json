By showing off your modding and driving skills, you’ll gain ‘Respect’ from the rival crew chiefs, and will soon be invited to their race events, challenge them to race ‘for pinks’ and bet against them for cash. As your notoriety grows, new drivers will ask to join your crew, opening up the never before seen ‘crew races’ where your skills at managing your drivers while you race are key to beating your rival crews.",

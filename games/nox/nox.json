  "description": "Jandor, the legendary hero of Nox, defeated evil necromancers and trapped their souls in an orb, which was then cast into another dimension. Years later, the necromancer Hecubah discovered that the orb was in the possession of Jack Mower, an ordinary guy who lives in a trailer somewhere on our Earth with his girlfriend. Hecubah retrieves the orb, which greatly increases her power, making her particularly dangerous to the inhabitants of Nox. However, Jack is teleported to Nox along with the orb, and appears to be the only one who can stop Hecubah.\r\n\r\nNox is an action role-playing game. It has similarities to Diablo, having isometric perspective and fast-paced action-oriented combat. The RPG elements, however, are less prominent than in Diablo, with the player character gaining experience for vanquishing enemies and leveling up automatically after completing the linear main quests. In the beginning of the game the player must choose a character class for Jack, making him either a fighter, a conjurer, or a wizard. The fighter is physically strong but can only use melee weapons or a few special combat abilities; the conjurer fights with bows and can summon monsters to help him in combat; the wizard has low hit points and cannot equip many weapons, compensating this with a vast array of magic spells.\r\n\r\nThe multiplayer component consists of modes that are normally found in online first-person shooters, including Deathmatch (sub-divided into \"free for all\", team, and clan modes), Capture the Flag, as well as other variations of competitive gameplay such as Flagball, King of the Realm, and Elimination.",

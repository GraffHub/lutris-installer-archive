  "description": "Pac-Man World 3 is the third game of the Pac-Man World series. This game differs greatly from the first two Pac-Man World games, as it has much more fighting and melee style gameplay. However, it shares something in common with Pac-Man World, in the case that is again Pac-Man's birthday, except now his 25th instead of his 20th. In the game, Pac-Man reunites with and receives help from a past enemy, Orson. He also teams up with Pinky and Clyde. The main enemy of the game is Erwin, who captures Blinky/Clyde and Inky.",

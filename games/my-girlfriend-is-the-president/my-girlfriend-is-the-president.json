  "description": "In the not so distant future, a young man awakes to find the White House next door! Why? Because your friend just became the president of New Japan!\r\n\r\nHondou never imagined his friend would be the leader of Japan, but this is his new life. She's the president, appointed by an alien overload that brainwashed all of humanity to believe in a new world order, lead by cute girls instead of army generals. He's taken a spot on the new moe administration, so things aren't that bad. What could go wrong?\r\n\r\nYou are the new trusted adviser to the president of New Japan, with the goal of returning the world to its original pre-alien-invasion state. How will you accomplish this? No idea, but you're going to try anyway! My Girlfriend is the President is a romantic comedy visual novel starring cute girl versions of real-world political figures. It features off-the-wall humor, tons of erotic content, and four cute girls to romance. Recommended to anyone looking for a lighthearted moe experience.",

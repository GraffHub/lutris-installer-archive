  "description": "Legion Arena is a sequel to the game Legion. Like its predecessor the game features epic battles in Roman times. But this time the battles are completely in 3D and in real-time. The resource management and city building aspect of Legion has been swept aside in favour of a focus on pure combat. At the end of each combat you receive money and fame, which can be used to buy new units and level up your existing units respectively. You can handpick different skills for each of your units and can customize their appearance. The game allows the player to play as either the Romans or the Gauls in over 100 scenarios. The game comes with 20 unique historically correct unit types.",

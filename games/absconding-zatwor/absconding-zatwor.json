  "description": "Your just an average guy. Nothing special. One day, you go to the gas station to get some cigarettes and see the cashier get murdered. The murderer escapes andwhen the police arrive, as you are the only one there, you are imprisoned for the crime. Now, you must escape (abscond) from the prison Zatwor, which will not be easy.\r\n\r\nAbsconding Zatwor is a stealth game where you must make your way to the exit area of each screen, avoiding ever increasing security, like cameras, sound detectors, roaming guards, lasers, etc. Movement is controlled by either the mouse or keyboard.",

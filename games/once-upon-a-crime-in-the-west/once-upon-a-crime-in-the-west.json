  "description": "Somewhere in the Old West, there lies a cabin full of corpses. If you had arrived moments sooner, you might have been one of them. It all started on Christmas Day, when The Old Sheriff of New Town was murdered. In the days that followed, several dangerous strangers would make their way to the Mount Inn, an isolated shelter on the mountain path between New Town and Old Town, and kill each other.\r\n\r\nNow itâ€™s down to you to untangle their motives and piece together the bigger picture from the gruesome aftermath. \r\n\r\nOnce Upon A Crime In The West is the highly anticipated third murder mystery game by National Insecurities, creators of the acclaimed Disorient on the Murder Express and 2000:1: A Space Felony.",

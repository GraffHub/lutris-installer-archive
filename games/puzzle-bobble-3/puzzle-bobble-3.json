  "description": "Puzzle Bobble 3 is extremely similar in design to other Bust-A-Move games, however instead of attaching its bubbles to the top of the screen, the bubbles are positioned around \"nodes\". Levels sometimes involve scrolling upwards, and there are also a selection of Bust-A-Move 2 levels included. It also includes the ability to select your character in versus mode. An enhanced version, titled Puzzle Bobble 3DX was also released, but this skipped Sega's consoles.",

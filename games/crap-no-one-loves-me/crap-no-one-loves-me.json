  "description": "“My morning ritual is pretty simple: I check my phone and scream CRAP! No One Loves Me” CRAP! No One Loves Me is a daily affirmation. It’s also a bobsledding journey into the netherworld by your friends Arcane Kids, creators of Zineth and Perfect Stride. Meet fellow teens at the Vape Shop. Pick a sick custom coffin. Boost into purgatory. Will the Baroness take pity on your lonely no-followers having soul, or will she grind your bones into dust? Is there a difference? Is there such a thing as relief?",

  "description": "The world of Rosarah is haunted by the ancient past. Grand civilizations fell to the iron fist of the Kithen Empire. The people suffered. But while the empire fell over 1,000 years ago, the guardians who protect Rosarah are dwindling.\r\n\r\nThey are the Librarians: the guardians of ancient knowledge and history, protectors of the 8 magic spell books which were originally used by evil to conquer Rosarah. In The Last Librarian, you play as Randel, who is thrust suddenly into his role as a Librarian when his grandfather is slain by an undead monster. You must unseal the spells, buried deep in well-guarded Libraries, in order to defend Rosarah once again from tyranny.",

  "description": "Tower in the Fountain of Sparks takes place on the dark side of Saturn X, where the UAC had set out to uncover the mysteries of the seemingly-abandoned alien cultures that once lived there. Settings include ancient ruins, dilapidated research outposts, gothic temples, and more.\r\n\r\nAs with the previous episode, Tower in the Fountain of Sparks is a fully vanilla-Doom2.exe-compatible mapset, and should be fully compatible with most common ports.\r\n\r\nDue to the mapping tricks and custom palette/colormap, software rendering is recommended for best effect when playing in a source port.",

  "description": "Based on part one of Dante Alighieri’s classic poem “The Divine Comedy,” Dante’s Inferno is a third-person action adventure game taking Dante on an epic journey through Hell as he seeks to rescue the soul of his beloved Beatrice. Descend through the nine circles of Hell: limbo, lust, gluttony, greed, anger, heresy, violence, fraud, and treachery. Each circle features distinct environments, enemies, and story elements befitting the sins committed by their inhabitants, with large-scale beasts and bosses, some of which Dante will be able to fully tame, utilizing them to throw back Hell’s wrath to its minions.Armed with Death’s Scythe, Beatrice’s Holy Cross, magic powers and a deep, customizable upgrade system, take full advantage of fast and fluid gameplay running at a constant 60 frames per second.",

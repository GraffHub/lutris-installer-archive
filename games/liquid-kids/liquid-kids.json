  "description": "Hipopo waddles through many cute levels in search of his girlfriend. He rescues other captured hippo-like animals on the way. He throws globes full of water that gushes when it hits a wall or creature. The water attack is exactly like Taito's Bubble Bobble water attack. The game is a 4-way scroller with very large levels and lots of surprises. Many of the levels have moving platforms, collapsing floors and other obstacles.",

  "description": "Megami Tensei Online: Imagine is an online RPG set in the Megaten universe. The time line of the game falls somewhere between Shin Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei II, following the destruction of Tokyo in year 202X, and the construction of a huge tower called \"Shinjuku Babel\" under the supervision of seven wisemen.\r\n\r\nMost trademark gameplay elements from Megaten games return in an online form: the players are given the opportunity to join fractions of Law or Chaos, or just become freelance mercenaries in the spirit of the Neutral alignment of Shin Megami Tensei. Demon conversations and fusion system are also present. Successfully recruited demonic allies follow the player, helping him in combat. Unlike most Megaten games, the battles take place in real time, like in other online RPGs.",

  "description": "Silentville was a small, undistinguished town. But most of all, it was silent. Nothing special ever happened there, until...\r\n\r\nOne sunny summer day, when, as usual, nothing unusual was happening, a very unusual storm came out of nowhere...\r\n\r\nIt's the kind of thing you don't quickly forget. Rumbling thunder, lightening... at times it appeared that the heavens themselves had fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment on, the people in Silentville started disappearing - one by one. Even the visitors suddenly disappeared without a trace.\r\n\r\nAirplanes and birds, trains and pedestrians, drivers, tourists and even bicyclers - all of them have vanished!\r\n\r\nThis is the story of Silentville - a town with no future, no past and no present. A town lost to forever - unless someone can solve the mystery and release Silentville from its cursed non-existence.\r\n\r\nBut should that someone fail, they will be trapped in Silentville... forever!",

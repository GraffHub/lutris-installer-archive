  "description": "A game about never-ending problem of loading screens. We've all experienced it while playing games, while downloading something, while installing an operating system ect. And now you can experience it once again in Loading Screen Simulator: Steam edition\r\n\r\nThis is a classical clicker style game. Click the button get points, spend those points, get more points, repeat, ...? , profit.\r\nOriginally this game started as a weekend project just for fun. And I never expected it to be a part of Steam but a lot of people wanted it, so here you go. You're welcome\r\n\r\nThis version is a little different from the original. It has 19 achievements and some minor changes\r\n\r\nMusic from the game was made by Kevin Macleod\r\nMusic from the trailer \"in the hall of the mountain king\"",

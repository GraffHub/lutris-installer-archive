  "description": "Final Fantasy Iâ€¢II is a compilation of the first two Final Fantasy games, released in Japan only for the Nintendo Famicom.\r\n\r\nBoth games are top-down role-playing games where the player-controlled party travels through the overworld, fighting enemies, buying weapons, armor and magic spells in shops, and resting in town inns. Combat is round-based: the player selects commands for the whole party, and then watches the combat round unfold. Games in this compilation are almost identical to their original counterpart, although some of the changes from the English release of Final Fantasy were kept.",

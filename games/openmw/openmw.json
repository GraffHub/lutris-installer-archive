  "description": "The project aims to address issues with the original engine, as Morrowind has had no support or bug-fix updates for many years. The engine is programmed in C++ and uses the Bullet physics engine, OpenAL-Soft for audio, MyGUI for window widgets, and SDL 2 for input. The launcher and OpenMW-CS tool use Qt for their graphical user interfaces. All the quests and other character choices of Morrowind and its official expansions and add-ons are fully playable in OpenMW, as are many third-party mods.\r\n\r\nAs a game engine recreation, it therefore relies on but does not include the original assets of the game, such as art, textures, music, and other Bethesda-copyrighted material, meaning a copy of the original game (in any edition, including the Game of the Year Edition) is required to play Morrowind in OpenMW. Side projects have been started to create free assets to accompany OpenMW, and the OpenMW-CS content-development tool can also be used without the need for any third-party assets.",

  "description": "AIR is primarily an action game with exploration and light role-playing elements. The player controls a tank-like space vehicle, moving from first-person perspective on planet surfaces. Several planets can be accessed and explored in any order. Contact with an enemy takes the player to a separate overhead screen where the battle takes place. The player must navigate the tank, shooting at the enemy and avoiding its attacks. Money is awarded, which can be spent to purchase more torpedoes and missiles, as well as repair the tank and buy new shields and batteries for it.",

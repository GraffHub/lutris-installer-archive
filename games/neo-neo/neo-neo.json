  "description": "Use a devastating and deadly warp ability to feed an ever-watchful Temple with souls and unlock true power! Neo Neo is a super fast paced arcade shooter set in a vibrant and colourful world where only death is a certainty.\r\n\r\n    Steal your enemies souls and weapons with the devastating warp ability. Say no more to grabbing the wrong damn weapon! The warp ability allows you to jump to any enemy, killing them and taking their fully loaded weapon.\r\n    Kill as many enemies as possible to improve your score within the never-ending Temple but beware, a none relenting flood is dead on your heels, every second stealing away all the souls you are too slow to kill yourself.\r\n    Bullets move fast but you move faster. Adrenaline kicks in when bullets are heading straight for your heart, giving you a hefty speed boost and slowing down time.\r\n    Unlock a wide range of perks that dramatically affect the way you hunt the enemy. Want to go on a shotgun frenzy? Be my guest! But be careful, each perk comes with deadly traits!\r\n    Have your eyes metaphorically boiled by an array of vibrant colours and effects, allowing over 5 different stunning colours due to state of the art technology.\r\n    The Temple is randomly generated on each run to allow for a constant flow of varied and bloody death.",

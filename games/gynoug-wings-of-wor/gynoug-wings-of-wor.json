You are Wor, a winged battle master with the power to hurl bolts of energy and control the magical forces of nature. Ahead of you is the greatest challenge ever: defeat the evil mutants of Iccus.\r\n\r\nFrom the underground caverns to the belly of the beast... and beyond... you must battle against some of the most grotesque, dangerous creatures ever. All will try to pluck the feathers from your back and crush the breath from your lungs.\r\n\r\nIt's six rounds of hot action that will put you on wings, soaring into the face of the enemy. So grab your control pad and get ready for the flight of your life!",

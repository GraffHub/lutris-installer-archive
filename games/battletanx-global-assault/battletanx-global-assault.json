  "description": "The introduction of tanks during the First World War revolutionised the way battles were fought, but now it looks as if modern warfare is set for another major change. Here come the Battletanx. Super heavy and awesomely powerful, there's only one way to stop them. You've got to meet like with like.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 a deadly virus swept the planet killing only women, decimating the female population to only a fraction of their former numbers. The human race was on the brink of extinction. Wars raged and governments collapsed as rivals made desperate grabs for the surviving women. Enter the vicious gangs and the peaceful tribes.\r\n\r\nIn fantastic 3D graphics, Battletanx: Global Assault allows you to tour the globe in the most destructive of one or two player styles. Choose a gang, choose a tank and the world is at your mercy, and that includes famous monuments and buildings. Had a bad day? Let the Eiffel Tower know all about it.",

  "description": "Enter Micropolis and take control. Be the undisputed ruler of a sophisticated real-time City Simulation. Become the master of existing cities such as San Francisco, Tokyo, and Rio de Janeiro, or create your own dream city (or nightmare slum) from the ground up.\r\n\r\nWhether you take over an existing city or build your own, you are the Mayor and City Planner with complete authority.\r\n\r\nYour city is populated by Sims -- Simulated Citizens. Like their human counterparts, they build houses, condos, churches, stores and factories. And, also like humans, they complain about things like taxes, mayors, taxes, city planners, and taxes. If they get unhappy, they move out; you collect fewer taxes, the city deteriorates.\r\n\r\nThe next few sections will explain the overall concept of Micropolis and give information that will help you win Scenarios and design and build better cities.",

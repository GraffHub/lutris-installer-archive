  "description": "The year is 3032. You own a hovercraft type spacecraft and earn your living by piloting it around the solar system, hired by large corporations and other entities to perform various tasks for a price. The more difficult, risky or illegal the mission, the higher the pay off.\r\n\r\nLander is a small, lightweight, maneuverable machine designed for tight above and below ground flying, controlled through a set of thrusters on the corners and a single main engine on its belly. With the money you earn, make needed repairs or improve Lander with better weapons, engines, armor â€“ or even replace it entirely. There are five grades of armor, four pulse energy weapons, three missile systems and four engines available when you have enough cash to purchase them.",

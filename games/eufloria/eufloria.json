  "description": "Eufloria is the commercial edition of the prototype originally known as Dyson. Compared to the initial version it offers a full single player campaign with multiple levels (the prototype only had a single level), a skirmish mode with eight additional levels, and an unlockable Dark Matter mode with new graphics and tougher AI. The single music track by Brian Grainger (Milieu) has been extended to two hours. It also incorporates LUA scripting (replacing XML from the first release) allowing for additional user generated content in the form of custom levels.",

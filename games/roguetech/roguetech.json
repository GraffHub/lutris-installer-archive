  "description": "RogueTech is a mod for BATTLETECH which has as goal to provide new challenges and a harsher sim game experience. Survive by any means necessary, because your enemies won't care if you live or die.\r\n\r\nThe timeline for this mod is at the start of 4th Succession and the War of 3039, when the the first technologies of the Helm Core appear around the sphere.\r\n\r\nTHIS MOD IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY, ENEMIES ARE SMARTER, PUSH THE LIMITS OF THEIR MECHS, AND WOULD LOVE TO GUT YOUR MECH LANCE FROM THE REAR IF YOU LET THEM.\r\n\r\nI mean, how fair would it be to just have the player have all these fancy toys?",

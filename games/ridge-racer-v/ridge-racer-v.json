  "description": "As with other titles in the Ridge Racer series, this is arcade racing action, discarding reality in favor of fantasy thrills. There are 14 tracks and 18 cars. You can play a full 'Grand Prix' type season, or play individual tracks against the clock, an opponent or a ghost car. Lighting and reflection effects are built in to the game engine, as is the ability to modify your car's paint job. Replays can be viewed from any angle. A full musical score is on offer",

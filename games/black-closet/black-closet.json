  "description": "9 AM Monday morning. A report lands on your desk: Jeanette's monogrammed silver locket has gone missing. The last time she definitely remembers having it, she was walking in the Field with her friend Susan. Shifty hallmate Ashley had also been admiring the locket recently.\r\n\r\nDo you:\r\n\r\nDrag Ashley in for interrogation?\r\nComb the Field for clues?\r\nTry to stimulate Jeanette's memory?\r\nPut Susan under surveillance?\r\n\r\nSolve the case quickly, and everyone will applaud your leadership. Be too heavy-handed in your approach, and public opinion will turn against you. Let a thief slip through your fingers to strike again, and the whole school's reputation will suffer.\r\n\r\nThis is no ordinary high school! Here the daughters of the rich and famous are polished and prepared for their futures on the world stage. Reputation is everything, and the competition is cutthroat... sometimes literally.\r\n\r\nCan you survive until your graduation?",

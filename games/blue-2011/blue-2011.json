  "description": "\"Kiss My Ass\"\r\nThese were the last words of a poet named Asagiri Sou. On a quiet, autumn's night, a young girl, Natsume Nishikujo, pieces together the mysteries this poet left behind, as she looks over his home town from the observation deck of a neglected park. She recalls meeting him for the first time, two years ago, in that park. And on that day, he told her of 'The Angel's Song', an urban legend from a decade ago. He told her of truth of the blue eyes of this angel that left him mesmerised.",

The other is enveloped in total darkness. \r\n\r\nOn each face life has developed in a different way. The bright side is inhabited by people who call themselves Strefis, the illuminated ones, while the dark side is populated by the Ugeltz, the people of night. \r\n\r\nNo Ugeltz has ever seen a Strefis however each civilisation remembers the other, in legends.\"",

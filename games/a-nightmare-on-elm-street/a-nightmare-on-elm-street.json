  "description": "Elm Street... where dreams are blurred with reality... where all dreams become nightmares... the street where Freddy lives.\r\n\r\nYou must go there. You alone have the power to save your friends and stop Freddy.\r\n\r\nYou sleep, and let the nightmare consume you, carrying you into the endless night of Freddy's world. Once there, you move quickly, driven by something between fear and determination, expecting strange horrors to lunge at you every step of the way.\r\n\r\nIs it real? No, it's the game of your life! It's A Nightmare on Elm Street... like the movie, but more terrifying because this time Freddy is after you!\r\n\r\nIt's a game of smarts, chances, dares and scares. And it all takes place in Freddy's world - a House of Horrors full of tunnels, mazes, spirals... with puzzles to master, weapons to choose from and unending dangers to conquer. And Freddy is in his finest hour... laughing, taunting, attacking... and cheating! You'll face surprises in every corner and impending doom with every step.",

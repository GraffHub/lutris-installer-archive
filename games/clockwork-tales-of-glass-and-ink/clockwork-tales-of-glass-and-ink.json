  "description": "Gargantuan earthquakes devastate city after city. Dr. Ambrose Ink, one of the greatest minds of the steam revolution, has undertaken the task of explaining why these supernatural quakes are occurring.\r\n\r\nHis investigation leads him to Hochwald, the small mountain town at the foot of the Barber Family Castle. However, soon after his arrival, Ink disappears under mysterious circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe only person who can find the doctor and unravel the mystery of the earthquakes is secret agent Evangeline Glass. But to do so, she will have to infiltrate the closely-guarded castle and discover the secret agenda of its current resident – Gerhard Barber, the General Engineer of Gottland.\r\n\r\nHer mechanical raven Matthew helps her along the way.\r\n\r\nDuring her mission, Evangeline will uncover many secrets – some that burn, like hot, billowing steam, violently and permanently.",

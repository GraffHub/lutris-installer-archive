  "description": "Raiden Fighters Jet is the apotheosis of the Raiden Fighters trilogy and arguably one of the greatest arcade shoot-em-ups of all time. While its style of play is similar to its two predecessors, it refines the formula to a level that borders on nigh-perfection. Raiden Fighters Jet's cast of planes and jets has been altered very little from Raiden Fighters 2, introducing only one new fighter into the fold. Almost every fighter from the previous game returns (including the Slaves and the Fairy), sans the Aegis II-c and Dark Sword. In their place is the really cool Ixion, the fighter prominently featured in the title screen. The Ixion has a powerful main cannon and is one of the fastest ships in the game, with straight flying napalm missiles that leave blue explosions and a neat \"cyclone beam\" that fires up to four lasers which cycle over each other. Unlike the two previous games, all ships are available for immediate play. Aside from some color changes in the weapons, all fighters function as they did in RF2.",

  "description": "Namco's surreal shoot-'em-up has arrived on PlayStation at last, and the classic arcade blast has been perfectly translated, including the 2-Player mode as you battle your way through 48 mind-bending stages.\r\n\r\nAn all-new feature for PlayStation is the Quest Mode where the players take on the roles of Dr Don & Dr Dan and guide them through a quest for hidden treasure on Gun Bullet Island.\r\n\r\nPoint Blank is the first game to support two G-Con 45's for 'unrivalled rivalry' for 2-Players and also contains support for normal controllers. Are you ready to adopt the bonkers personae of Dr Don & Dr Dan?\r\n\r\nPoint Blank, about as much fun as you can have whilst keeping your clothes on!",

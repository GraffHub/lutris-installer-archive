  "description": "Dungetris is a game in a Rogue-like genre with an original system of building a level and the elements of a card game. \r\n\r\nBuild!\r\nYou build a tower by using the rules which are similar with the famous game. Finish the construction of the castle to the certain height and fight with a boss. These goals are the main ones in each level. \r\n\r\nPlay!\r\nThere are no standard items and inventory. You can help to your hero by means of playing cards. Everything, that you can find in the game, from weapon to quest is presented by playing cards. Collect them all! \r\n\r\nThink!\r\nCards and blocks need to be used wisely. Sometimes the wrong step can lead you to the dead end.",

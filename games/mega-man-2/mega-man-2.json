But as MegaMan, you've also grown in power and ability. Can you save mankind from the evil desires of Dr. Wily?\r\n\r\nEach of the eight empires is ruled by a different super-robot. You must defeat each enemy on his own turf, building up weapons as you go. Only after all are destroyed will you go head-on with the mastermind himself, the evil Dr. Wily. But be alert, MegaMan, Dr. Wily has powers his creations did not!\r\n\r\nCivilization relies on your skill and courage - confident that you, MegaMan, will stand tall in the end!",

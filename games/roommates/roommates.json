Okay, maybe we're overselling it.\r\n\r\nEither way, you're invited along with either Max or Anne as they make their way through the first year of their college experience.\r\n\r\nThey'll share their dorm life with four other tenants as they pick their class load, pick their jobs, and maybe even pick someone to have a little extra curricular fun with.\r\n\r\nNeither of them can get through college without you, so who will you help? Rock god Max or Book-smart Anne? Between bitter tenured professors and a ridiculously distracting student body, it's going to take everything they've got just to make it to year two.",

  "description": "You're a new recruit in the mermaid army, working under Commander Flipsy, the dolphin. After a successful job in shark territory, you're given a top secret mission: become a human and learn the truth about the Titanic.\r\n\r\nSee, the humans are building a giant ship called the Titanic. It's the largest ship that has ever been built, which has the mermaids worried. Could it be the humans are planning to invade the mermaid kingdom? The ship launches later this week, so you don't have a lot of time to explore the human world and discover what's going on.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, there are three other mermaids who have been sent on this mission. All three of them disappeared, and no one has any idea what happened to them. Can you avoid their fate? Can you successfully pose as a human, without being discovered by your curious roommate Andreas or the foul villain Maynard? Will you help the mermaids destroy the Titanic, or will you choose to side with the humans?",

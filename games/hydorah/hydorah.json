  "description": "The plot: An evil force launched an invasion over the Omios star. Equip your ship, select a route and fight planet by planet against hordes of meroptians. Biomechanical enemies, space creatures, dangerous landscapes and climatic threats are waiting for you.\r\n\r\nThe game: Hydorah is a nonlinear classic shmup with a large library of levels and enemies. There is a single difficulty level, based on the 80s standards, that requires mastering in order to progress. Graphics are simple enough to not interfere with the gameplay, while they're polished to show the unique personality of each level. It has a huge soundtrack composed exclusively by Gryzor87, who has not hesitated in taking legendary synthesizers to create retro futuristic, powerful and sometimes dark themes. Every track has been designed to fit each level like a glove.\r\n\r\n* Old school gameplay and 16-32 bit appeal.\r\n* 16 levels divided into 27 sublevels, 30 bosses and more than 70 enemies.\r\n* Non linear level scheme with route selection.\r\n* Dangers of different nature in each level (not just bullets).\r\n* Weapon selection menu, power ups and unlockable new weapons in every mission.\r\n* Huge original Soundtrack with 49 tracks.\r\n* Secret objects and special heroic ending",

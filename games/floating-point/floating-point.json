  "description": "Floating Point is a free, peaceful game about using a grappling hook to swing yourself gracefully through randomly generated spaces. In the air, you're fighting gravity. When you splash down beneath the water, you're fighting your own buoyancy to swing yourself further into the depths.\r\n\r\nThe only objective is to collect points, and the only thing that increases your points is swinging swiftly, smoothly and elegantly without hitting anything. As you pick up momentum, you start to glow, the bars you're collecting rise up, the music kicks in, and your trajectory burns a bright red line in the air, drawing huge, beautiful mathematical curves of your arcing flight.\r\n\r\nAlso the name is a pun, so that's cool.

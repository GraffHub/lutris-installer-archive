  "description": "Battlevoid: Harbinger is a strategy game where you, as a commander, work in turn-based overall strategy and real-time space battles. The game contains many different aspects and variables that you have to take into account in every decision. You have complete control over your fleet, equipment and resources that you need to balance to win in the long term. Strategy, tactics, and resource management are the core of everything you do.\r\n\r\nThis is the third game in the Battlestation series, following Battlestation: Classic and Battlestation: First Contact. It is loosely inspired by the TV series Babylon 5 and the game FTL: Faster Than Light. All games in the series have their own story and can be played individually, but they do have a consistent lore to be played one after the other.",

  "description": "Once again, Sophia and I set out to do a short project (but this time with a deadline). We wanted to make a game before 2017's Bit Bazaar, an event we'd be attending to show Arc Symphony.\r\n\r\nWe toyed with some ideas regarding personalities inside different drives, or of existing on a drive and being booted in different bodies. Once we had settled on some idea of what the game would play like, the scope got away from us (as it always does).\r\n\r\nWe divided the drives between the two of us. I would write Yellow and Purple, Sophia Green and Red.\r\n\r\nIt was fun, if a little horrific to explore these characters. How did they react with their backs against the wall? It's easy to be empathetic for someone who is nice, but it gets harder when the thing you are attempting to humanize is ugly, difficult, manipulative, terse.\r\n\r\nWe all want to be treated as human, and we all have the same claim to life. But our outer appearance often determines how human others see as us, and how much our life is worth to them. LOCALHOST, at least to me, asks a single question: is anyone really qualified to decide who lives and who dies?",

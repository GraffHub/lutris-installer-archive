  "description": "Guacamelee! is a Metroid-vania style action-platformer set in a magical Mexican inspired world. The game draws its inspiration from traditional Mexican culture and folklore, and features many interesting and unique characters.\r\n\r\nGuacamelee! builds upon the classic open-world Metroid-vania style of games, by adding a strong melee combat component, a new dimension switching mechanic, and cooperative same-screen multiplayer for the entire story. The game also blurs the boundaries between combat and platforming by making many of the moves useful and necessary for both of these.\r\n\r\nTravel through a mystical and mysterious Mexican world as a Luchador using the power of your two fists to battle evil. Uncover hidden wrestling techniques like the Rooster Uppercut, and Dimension Swap to open new areas and secrets.\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n*    Use combat moves for both fighting enemies and platforming challenges\r\n*    Swap between multiple overlapping dimensions (World of the Living and the World of the Dead)\r\n*    \"El Infierno\" level expansion. Brave the fires of El Infierno and prove yourself in a series of challenges to unlock powerful new costumes for Juan and Tostada\r\n*    Player costumes! Swap costumes to change the attributes of your Hero, and obtain new achievements\r\n*    Steam Achievements, Leaderboards, Cloud Save, and Big Picture Mode\r\n*    Trading Cards\r\n*    Create new custom costumes and share these with others via Steam Workshop\r\n*    Drop in/out 2-Player local Co-operative play for the entire story\r\n*    Chickens.

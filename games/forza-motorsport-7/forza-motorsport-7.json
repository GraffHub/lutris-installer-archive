The game contains over 700 cars and 200 tracks in 32 locations, unlike the 450 cars and 26 tracks of Forza Motorsport 6.\r\n\r\nIn terms of gameplay, the game does not differ much from its predecessor. A lot of the 700 cars come from Forza Horizon 3 and all tracks from Forza Motorsport 6 are also included in this installment. Some tracks from other games in the series are also included in this game, including Forza Motorsport 4.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other Forza Motorsport games, this installment features the dynamic weather first introduced in Forza Horizon 3. Players can also customize the appearance of their driver. The game features a singleplayer and multiplayer experience as usual. The campaign mode is played against AI and the multiplayer mode can be played against AI or other players. The game features the same Drivatar system that Forza Motorsport 5 introduced to the series.",

  "description": "The designers of the Bard's Tale series, Wasteland and Battle Chess pooled their talents to create the ultimate role-playing fantasy. The result was Dragon Wars.\r\nSailing across uncharted seas, you and your party are in search of a legendary paradise called Dilmun - a place where the streets are paved with gold and no one wants for anything.\r\nHowever, King Drake of Phoebus has declared all magic illegal - magickers have been slain or fled into exile. In retaliation, enemy islands have threatened to unleash their guardian dragons, the most destructive force in the world. While docked at a harbor in Dilmun, you are arrested on suspicion of spellcasting.\r\nImprisoned and stripped of everything but your wits, you are sentenced to life in a cesspool called Purgatory. Magic is your only salvation - a worldly possession in a world possessed.\r\n\r\n*    Over 60 monsters and 65 spells.\r\n*    A unique combat system: choose complexity of combat resolution, determine spell strength, select tactics of ranged combat.\r\n*    A paragraph book to enhance storytelling.",

  "description": "You've really done it now. You've put yourself right in the pilot's seat. So be prepared for hours of high-flying excitement as you try to make a CHOPPER RESCUE.\r\n\r\nA whole country is depending on you!\r\n\r\nYou have to do some of the trickiest flying that’s ever been done over three types of terrain. But you can't let anything stop you. You have to pick up vital medical supplies and deliver them where disaster has struck. If you fail, thousands will die.\r\n\r\nFly like you’ve never flown before\r\n\r\nYou have to avoid tall buildings and high-flying birds just to make the pick-up. And things get worse after that. In order to make the drop you have to have pinpoint accuracy and very steady nerves.",

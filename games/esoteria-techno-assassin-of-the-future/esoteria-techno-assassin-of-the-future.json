  "description": "I present this file to you, the public, because it is your right as a loyal esoterian citizen, to know of the danger that you are in. Our government has kept this a secret from You for far too long. I shall remain anonymous, for I fear that my own life is of little consequence to those that wish to see this frightening project achieve mass production.\r\n\r\nProject Raven is a weapon of silent destruction that has been stolen for use as a terrorist threat against You, the people of Esoteria. General Kazan, leader of the separatist movement, has threatened to unleash an army of Ravens onto other planets of Esoteria. Against these genetically enhanced killers, there is little defence.\r\n\r\nMay God help us all...",

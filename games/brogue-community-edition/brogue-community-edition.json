  "description": "Countless adventurers before you have descended this torch-lit staircase, seeking the promised riches below. As you reach the bottom and step into the wide cavern, the doors behind you seal with a powerful magic...\r\nWelcome to the Dungeons of Doom!\r\n\r\nBrogue is a single-player strategy game set in the halls of a mysterious\r\nand randomly-generated dungeon. The objective is simple enough -- retrieve the\r\nfabled Amulet of Yendor from the 26th level -- but the dungeon is riddled with\r\ndanger. Horrifying creatures and devious, trap-ridden terrain await. Yet it is\r\nalso riddled with weapons, potions, and artifacts of forgotten power. Survival\r\ndemands strength and cunning in equal measure as you descend, making the most\r\nof what the dungeon gives you. You will make sacrifices, narrow escapes,\r\nand maybe even some friends along the way -- but will you be one of the\r\nlucky few to return alive?",

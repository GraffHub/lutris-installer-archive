  "description": "In N, you play as a ninja whose world is populated solely with robots. Unlike other pop culture ninjas, this ninja is equipped with no weapons, and must rely entirely on speed, flexible mobility, and the way of N.\r\n\r\nAs we all know, ninjas possess an irrational thirst for gold. So while dodging laser blasts and homing missiles, N's ninja also has the opportunity to satisfy the lucre craving.\r\n\r\nN is a puzzle-platformer featuring 150 levels encapsulated in 30 episodes, with a time limit of 90 seconds per episode. Gameplay progress is saved after each episode (comprising 5 levels), but the player can indefinitely retry a level if they die.\r\n\r\nN features physics-based control in a tile-based world. Distinguishing characteristics include complex collision detection, and quirky ragdoll physics.",

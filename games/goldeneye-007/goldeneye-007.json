  "description": "GoldenEye 007 brings the world's most famous secret agent, James Bond, to life on the Nintendo 64-- complete with license to kill. Using the full power of the Nintendo 64, GoldenEye 007 puts you right into 007's tux and bow tie in a first-person action spectacular. But there's more to it than just blowing away bad guys-- you will have to accomplish a variety of espionage objectives, like planting covert modems, copying top secret documents, and diverting the destructive course of the rogue GoldenEye satellite system.\r\n\r\nGoldenEye 007 puts would-be double \"O\" operatives through the paces in 20 challenging missions, each with three different difficulty levels. With each difficulty level, the intelligence of your opponents increases and the complexity and number of objectives grows. Following and expanding on the story line of the hit movie, GoldenEye 007's missions span the globe; from a secret base in arctic Russia to the a giant satellite antenna cradle suspended over the steaming jungles of Cuba.",

  "description": "Konami's long-running series of Castlevania games makes its debut on the N64. The traditional 2D graphics have been left behind; this is the first Castlevania game in 3D. However, the goal of the game remains the same: kick some vampire butt as you battle the evil Count Dracula and his minions in this platformer.\r\n\r\nThe player can either choose to be Reinhardt Schneider (for traditional \"whip action\") or Carrie Fernandez (who uses magical powers). Both characters are given an own story line. A new feature is the presence of an in-game clock that switches the game time from day to night.",

  "description": "The severe fun of Incredible Crisis is all about maintaining your sanity, as you help Taneo's family get home for Grandma's Birthday.\r\n\r\nIt's a happy day and the worst day of their life, as they endure hundreds of hilarious and cardiac-arrest inducing dilemmas.\r\n\r\nYou'll laugh, cry, freak-out and perhaps soil your shorts, while your mental and physical reflexes are put to the test.\r\n\r\nThe controls are simple, but thumb and forefinger injury is still a risk.\r\n\r\nBe warned, this game is severely fun and may cause obsessive compulsive behavior, if not nervous disorders and/or involuntary twitches.\r\n\r\nEnjoy severe fun.\r\n\r\n* 24 Mini-Games!\r\n* Music by Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra!",

  "description": "stellia Online is a Classical MMORPG striving to return the genre to its roots. That is not to say it is a remake of what has been done before, but instead, a tribute to the original tenants of the MMORPG Phenomena combined with innovation and promise. Set in a vibrant fantasy world, Astellians are heroes blessed by the stars to call upon magical allies known as Astells. Each Astellian is charged with protecting the innocents of the world, a task that will take them through the darkest dungeons and across countless battlefields. Take up the Hero's Mantle and let your grand adventure begin; Astellia boasts a wide variety of unique and diverse dungeons, both for the solo player as well as parties, that reward those adventurers based on how well they perform. What better way to test your hard earned dungeoneering rewards than to take them to the arena? Arenas in Astellia offer both cooperative and competitive styles; whether you want to team up with your friends to fight hordes of monsters or go toe to toe against your fellow Astellians, the Coliseum will always provide for your competitive needs.",

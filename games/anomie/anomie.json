  "description": "“Some would call this a dystopia. It is, after all, a time in history where your individual will cannot be respected as it once could. We are, after all, on the brink of becoming a dying breed. Or so they say, anyway. \r\n\r\nI am being ripped out of my ordinary life, and I will be put into the system's hands. I understand why. I understand why it's necessary. On some level, I am even relieved by it. Social disinterest. Isolation. They have a plan for making this right, because so far it has all been so, so wrong. Every fiber of my body can attest to that.\r\n\r\nI am soon getting on a bus together with the rest of the young, healthy people of my neighborhood. We are leaving for a settlement. It's a settlement where futures are made, supposedly. Where free wills are neglected, presumably. Where the human race will get another chance at surviving, hopefully.\" \r\n\r\n―Quentin, protagonist of Anomie\r\n\r\nAnomie is set in a fictional world that resembles our modern day. The protagonist, Quentin, finds himself experiencing a chain of events that leads him to what can only be described as a new life. A new place with new rules—a new life, a new future. Will the public authority's desperate efforts bear fruit?",

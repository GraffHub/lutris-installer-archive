  "description": "Giana's Return is a multi platform sequel, taking place few years after the The Great Giana Sisters.\r\n\r\nThe Great Giana Sisters is an alltime Commodore 64 Jump'n'Run classic, which borrowed several elements from the well known Nintendo hit Super Mario. Created in 1987 by Armin Gessert (1963 - 2009), Manfred Trenz and Chris Huelsbeck; published by Rainbow Arts.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the same year Armin Gessert passed away, his company Spellbound Entertainment AG released an official sequel for Nintendo DS, which is now also available for iPhone and Android devices.\r\n\r\nGiana's Return is a tribute to the original game, but also in remembrance of Armin Gessert.",

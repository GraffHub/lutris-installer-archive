  "description": "The player is presented with a rectangular grid containing several types of diamonds. The object of the game is to swap neighbored diamonds to assemble a line of three similar diamonds. These lines will vanish and the board will be refilled with new diamonds. The game time is limited, try to build as much lines as possible to earn a high score.\r\n\r\nClick on one diamond, then on one of its neighbors. The diamonds will then be swapped. If no line of at least three diamonds is formed by the swap, it will be reverted. The status bar displays the game time left, and the number of points you have earned.",

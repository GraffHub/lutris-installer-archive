Wounded in the battle, Bastian gets a second chance to serve the Empire in a factory building tanks. Some of the people in the factory are linked to Bastian's past and some to his future. They say love is blind, but in this case love and where it leads our young protagonist can completely change his future and the course of the war. A chain of events and a cry from his past make Bastian question his loyalty and his side in the war.",

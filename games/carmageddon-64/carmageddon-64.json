  "description": "n Carmageddon, the player races a vehicle against a number of other computer controlled competitors in various settings, including city, mine and industrial areas. The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors' cars, or by running over pedestrians.\r\n\r\nRaces are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, \"wasting\" (wrecking) all other race cars, or killing all pedestrians on the level. The game includes thirty six race tracks, played across eleven different maps.",

  "notes": "- After a few hours or maybe minutes, depending on your system and the map you're playing, the game could fall into an stop n' go mode. Just restart ARK and you'll be good.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes changing graphic settings to low and back to your configuration solves the problem sometimes as well.",

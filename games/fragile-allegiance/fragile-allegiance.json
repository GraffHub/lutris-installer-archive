  "description": "In a future where the Earth can no longer support its ever-increasing population, pioneers have established colonies on countless new worlds. The fortunate ones have prospered and thrived, mining the precious ores and minerals that they found there, and the unfortunate have succumbed to the ravages of deep space.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2496, you are appointed Colony Director for Tetracorp and it is your job to build a thriving colony while defending it from 6 alien species. Fragile Allegiance offers a fast-paced RTS where you can buy blueprints, hunt for asteroids to mine, or even build an Asteroid Engine and use it against an opponent whoâ€™s been a thorn in your side! If you favor a more underhanded approach to furthering your goals, you can deploy Spy Satellites and Sabotage Agents to thoroughly undermine your enemies. Once you expand beyond the scope of one colony, you can appoint Colony Managers to take care of the more minor details of running and maintaining your colony.\r\n\r\nRemember, life is fragile; the future is in your hands!\r\n\r\n* Assemble your fleets, fill your silos with nuclear warheads, conduct research, gather resources, and wage war in a vast galaxy in this unique take on 4X Strategy.\r\n* Appoint Colony Supervisors to manage your colony and deploy Spy Satellites for the ultimate in skulduggery.\r\n* Negotiate and trade with 6 different alien cultures, each with their own unique personality.",

  "description": "Lin Yang was unemployed when he graduated from college this summer, so he went back to his hometown, planning to start his own convenience store.\r\n——｢Well, though I don’t have any employees yet, I’m a boss now.｣\r\nThat was what he thought at the beginning...\r\nHowever, a string of mysterious wind chimes changed this situation, maybe even his life. Along with the ringing chimes blown by the summer wind, three strange looking girls, each with a different pair of furry ears, appeared out of nowhere before him. He didn’t know who they were and they seemed to have some sort of secret with them, but Lin Yang decided to accept them anyway, and also hired them in this new convenience store.\r\nWell, no secret can stay a secret forever. Despite working his heart out, Lin has no experience in running anything. What lies ahead on their road of adventure? It’s for you to find out.",

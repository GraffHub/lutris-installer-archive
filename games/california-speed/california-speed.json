WE'LL GET YOUR MOTOR RUNNING!\r\n\r\n    Burn rubber through California sites like L.A., San Diego, Monterey, San Francisco, the Mojave Desert (hot, hot, hot) and many more!\r\n    Scoot down 11 original tracks (all with plenty of shortcuts) plus 5 hidden tracks! Race at night, in overcast conditions or on one of those typically sunny California days. Got your shades?\r\n    Custom-build your speed machine with all the essentials! Cool rims, brilliant colors, automatic and manual transmissions. Whether you decide on a muscle car, your dream car, a golf cart or a speed machine, you'll have 21 cars to choose from, including some surprises!\r\n    Compete in the \"California Series\", a 3 week event divided into 3 divisions: Light, Sport and Heavy.

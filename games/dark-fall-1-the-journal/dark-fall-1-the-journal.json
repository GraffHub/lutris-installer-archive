  "description": "This first-person, point and click adventure is an atmospheric ghost story which takes place primarily in an old train station and a nearby hotel in Dorset, England.\r\n\r\nThe game begins as you listen to a phone message from your brother urging you to meet him immediately because \"something has gone wrong\" and that \"what they were looking for has found them.\" You leave immediately and, upon arriving, you discover that your brother is only one of many whose disappearances are unexplained.\r\n\r\nYour investigations into the past and present will involve reading diaries, newspapers, letters and other records to uncover the secrets hiding in the buildings. You will be finding clues to puzzles as you explore the creepy environment where apparitions come forth without warning.\r\n\r\nThe in 2009 released Classic Edition adds support for Windows XP and Vista, new sound effects and other technical adjustments.",

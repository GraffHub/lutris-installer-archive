  "description": "HOKY is a minimalist local multiplayer game from the abstract minds of Kitty Calis and Jan Willem Nijman, with audio by Eirik Suhrke.\r\n\r\nA non-traditional take on the classic sport of hockey, HOKY bends the rules and intentionally avoids deep knowledge of the source material. Ignorance or a fresh perspective? There's only one way to find out! Up to four players grab their sticks and slide onto the ice, cheered on by dynamic audience AI and their personal lust for sports.",

  "description": "CUTTHROATS\r\nHardscrabble Island is a little seaport that's about as picturesque as it sounds. \"Past its prime\" is being polite. You're hardly the polite sort yourself, but as an expert diver, you have agreed to help salvage the sunken treasure from one of the four local shipwrecks. The only thing between you and the treasure is the gang of cutthroat characters you're working with. Of course, the only link between you and the treasure is the gang of cutthroat characters you're working with.\r\n\r\nThink logically, choose your friends carefully, know your enemies well and you may live to play another game, going after the treasure on another shipwreck.",

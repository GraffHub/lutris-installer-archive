In the end, only one of them may be left standing.\r\n\r\nThe final chapter in the epic Legacy of Kain series is a time-bending, dimension-crossing, action-adventure game featuring more fast-paced combat than ever before. Take control of two mighty and highly-evolved vampires, each with a vast arsenal of combat moves and elaborate combos to unlock during their journey. A world filled to the brim with gruesome monsters, conflict and intrigue lies before them.\r\n\r\nCan you handle the combined power of this demonic duo?",

The game was developed by Probe Entertainment for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation and Iguana Entertainment for the Nintendo 64 and published by Acclaim Entertainment.\r\n\r\nSimilar to Descent, Forsaken had a strong following due to its \"six degrees of freedom\" gameplay, but suffered in popularity as compared to the conventional ground-based 3D first-person shooter games.",

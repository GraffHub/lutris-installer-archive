  "description": "Putting a new, ahem, spin on the customizing-and-battling challenges of videogames and card games, you build battle tops and match up with other Beybladers in a battle for supremacy.\r\n\r\nBeyblades battle in special stadiums. At match's end, the last Beyblade still spinning and in the stadium is the winner. Each customizable Beyblade has five key parts - the Bit, Attack Ring, Weight Disk, Spin Gear and Blade Base.\r\n\r\nWhen launching your Beyblade, a well-timed button press can increase its spin power. During battles, you can unleash special abilities called Bit Beasts. With the press of a button, an ancient beast such as a dragon or bear will come to life within the Beyblade, transforming it into a virtually unstoppable fighting machine.\r\n\r\nYou have limited control over the movements of your Beyblade, so timing and strategic use of your Bit Beasts are vital to victory. Of course, customizing your Beyblade and upgrading parts is just as important.",

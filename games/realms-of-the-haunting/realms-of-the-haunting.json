  "description": "Forged in the Beginning and protected by the Seven Seals, there lies a place where thought and creation intertwine. The center for all realms of existence, it is the balancing force between good and evil, man and spirit. A focal point for all energies, and the one element that has kept the consuming nature of darkness at bay... Until now.\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n* Many unique and bizarre universes to explore. From a modern age, mysterious mansion to a medieval, surreal world full of monsters.\r\n* Excellent blend of first-person shooter and point-and-click adventure.\r\n* Full-motion video cut-scenes with live actors bring the game's well-written story alive.",

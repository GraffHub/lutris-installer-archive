  "description": "An alien teenager runs away from home and lands on our planet. Being a troublesome adolescent, he begins to do what any young punk with superpowers would do – kill and destroy. Without any previous briefing on the subtleties of your mission, a four-man team of professional ”problem-solvers” is sent to the site to deal with the criminal.\r\n\r\nHellsquad is an adventure game in the Lucasfilm tradition, but with some action elements and a control mechanism that diverts from the typical point-and-click one. All movements are directly controlled with joystick or keyboard, instead of setting a target with the mouse. Using the fire button, you use your gun to shoot at enemies. Depending on your position on the screen, you may use objects on-screen on in your inventory, or use one object on another. You may switch between your four soldiers at any time, while the inactive ones regenerate their health. Since they all share the same inventory, it is possible for one character to pick up an object which can be used by a trapped character to escape, and you may also spread out to investigate different scenes with less walking around.\r\n\r\nIn-game graphics are mostly hand-drawn with rotoscoped characters for natural movements. A full motion video intro sets the scene. The writing is in the humourous point-and-click adventure tradition, with lots of cursing to spice things up.",

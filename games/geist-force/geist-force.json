  "description": "Geist Force(ガイストフォース) is an unreleased Sega Dreamcast game, one of the first games to be announced for the console, and also one of the first to be cancelled.\r\n\r\nNot much was known about the game for many years, other than it was a space-ship shooter similar to the likes of Star Fox 64 on the Nintendo 64. It was featured in several magazines and a couple of videos were released, but the game ultimately did not surface.\r\n\r\nThe game was first shown at E3 1998, then again at the 1998 Tokyo Game Show where it was reportedly 80% complete. The two versions differed significantly, with speculation that the E3 version was entirely pre-rendred and used less than \"30% of the Dreamcast's power\". The project was originally due to be released as a launch title for the system in North America, but was cancelled sometime after mid-1999.\r\n\r\nReportedly Geist Force was cancelled after political in-fighting amongst the team and missed deadlines. According to lead programmer Nimai Malle, the artwork was 90% done and the programming between 65-70% complete. There was also a lack of confidence of the game succeeding in Japan[2].\r\n\r\nA prototype was acquired by ASSEMblergames after a series of donations in the first half of 2011, with the intention of releasing the game to the general public, with donors receving specially-pressed discs capable of running on Dreamcast hardware.",

  "description": "Dofus is a Flash based massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Ankama Games, a French computer game manufacturer. Originally released solely in French, it has since been translated into many other languages. It is primarily a Pay to Play game, though it still offers a limited amount of free content. Its success has led to the marketing of spin-off products, such as books, art, comics and a movie which was planned for release in 2013. It has also led to the development of two continuations: Dofus Arena, released at the beginning of 2006, which is an alternative \"tournament\" version of Dofus; and Wakfu, a continuation of Dofus. The game has attracted over 10 million players worldwide  and is especially well known in France.",

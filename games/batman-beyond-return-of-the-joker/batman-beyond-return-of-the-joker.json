  "description": "In the mid 21st century, Bruce Wayne has retired from crime-fighting and the last known sighting of Batman occurred over twenty years ago. But evil never rests in Gotham City. Now, a menacing street gang known as the Jokerz terrorizes innocent citizens. But when the Jokerz burglarize several computer operating systems for their high-tech components, Wayne suspects someone else is the mastermind behind their schemes. Wayne reluctantly agrees to let his new teenage protege Terry McGinnis, the new Batman, investigate the recent chaos. McGinnis is barely on the case when Wayne is nearly killed by The Joker at a shareholder meeting for Wayne Enterprises. How could The Joker, the seemingly immortal Clown Prince of Crime, still be alive and stronger than ever? The secret rests in what transpired the night Batman fought The Joker for the last time. Now it's up to you to find out and avenge your mentor before The Joker's last laught is on you.",

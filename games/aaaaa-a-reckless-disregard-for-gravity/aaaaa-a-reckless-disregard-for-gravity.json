  "description": "The jumps you make off buildings floating above Boston, Massachusetts are all about style and timing. You perform stunts, weaving around the bustling City for points, making split-second decisions: do you snake around those girders to earn a dozen “kisses,” or glide along the side of that steel super-skyscraper for massive “hugs”?\r\n\r\nAaaaa! then throws in the spectators — as you fall, give fans the thumbs-up and protesters the finger. And if you’re hungry for a bit of civil disobedience, you can even ready the spraypaint and tag government buildings for points.\r\n\r\nThe game will also teach you how to debristle a pig.",

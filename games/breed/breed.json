After a long and costly war with the robotic alien race nick-named the Breed, your warship returns to Earth only to discover that the entire war only was a diversion.\r\n\r\nNow Earth has fallen into the hands of the Breed and only you and your men can stop it...\r\n\r\nTo do this you must take control of a squad of soldiers and win 18 different missions. They take place on tropical islands, Antarctica and even outer space. There is a variety of vehicles including tanks, buggies and fighter jets, ensuring that a range of control skills must be mastered. Everything you see can be blown up, with weapons including plasma guns, assault rifles and grenades.",

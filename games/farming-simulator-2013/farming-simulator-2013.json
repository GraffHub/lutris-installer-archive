  "description": "Farming Simulator 2013 is the 2012 edition in the series of farming simulation games. Compared to the earlier titles it includes a host of new features and improvements. In the career mode the player takes on the role of a farmer and experiences the farming life in a new and freely accessible landscape. It has an economy system with variable corn prices that allows the player to earn money more strategically and invest in new buildings, vehicles and tools. There are over 100 authentic tractors, harvesters and tools of licensed manufacturers such as Case IH, Deutz-Fahr, Lamborghini, Same, Horsch, and Amazone.\r\n\r\nThis edition introduces animal husbandry and purchasable fields where objects and buildings can be constructed. There are now three animal types (chicken, sheep and cows) compared to just cows before, and more diverse crops including sugar beet and potatoes. The growth state of crops is now influenced by the weather. Up to 10 players can manage a farm together online or through a local network. Mods, vehicles and equipment can also be shared with other players.",

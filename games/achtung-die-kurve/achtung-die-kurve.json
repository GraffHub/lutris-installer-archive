  "description": "Achtung, die Kurve!, also known as Zatacka or simply Achtung, is a freeware, multiplayer DOS computer game that supports from two-player up to eight-player gaming simultaneously. The game is a clone of the lesser known Cervi (Worms) from 1993, differing in that the lines now have holes. Author is Filip Oscadal, aka Fred Brooker, from the Czech Republic who made this game, together with Kamil Dolezal, for Amiga incl. music, sound effects and gfx background (worm speed depending on the picture). The game is supposedly from 1995 and written in Borland C++.\r\n\r\nThe game bears some resemblance to the game Snake, though in \"Achtung, Die Kurve!\" the main goal is to make the opponent hit the wall without hitting anything else by yourself. As a result, the game closely resembles the famous Light Cycle of the 1982 film Tron. The Kurve is controlled by only two buttons: one makes the snake turn left; the other, right. The main difference between Achtung and Snake is that Achtung can only be played multi-player, while Snake remains a single player game; although some versions of the game support single-player gameplay (for example IPCurve), you play against computer controlled Kurven in comparison to Snake, where you are there only by yourself.\r\n - Wikipedia",

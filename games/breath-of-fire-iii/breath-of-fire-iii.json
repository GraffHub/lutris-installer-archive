This is done using a gene-splicing system that dictates what sort of form Ryu will take.\r\n\r\nBreath of Fire III also includes a Master System, which permits Ryu and his allies to learn from various people to augment their abilities differently as they gain experience; these trainers can also teach abilities to those whom train hard under them.",

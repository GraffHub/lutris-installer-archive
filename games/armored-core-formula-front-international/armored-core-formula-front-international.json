  "description": "Players assume the role of an AI “Architect” who can customize the personality, capabilities and tactics of their mecha. \r\nPlayers must use all their wits in tuning their mecha so that it takes the optimal course of action in terms of analyzing opponents and the terrain, implementing aggressive and defensive tactics, piloting itself and reacting to whatever the circumstances may be. Have the most powerful mecha around by analyzing its performance out on the battlefield and augmenting its weaknesses through a process of repeated fine-tuning. \r\nAlso, this entry in the Armored Core series now offers an “Action Mode” that allows players to directly control their mecha. \r\nCustomize your mecha and its AI to set it loose to fight, or take control of the battle yourself. The choice is yours!",

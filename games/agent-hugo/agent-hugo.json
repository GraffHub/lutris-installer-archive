  "description": "Hugo, the TV troll from the Danish television series, is on his way to start his first day at the espionage agency R.I.S.K. (Risky Intelligent Spy Knights) when he is attacked by members of the sinister organization SUSPECTRA. Their plans are threatening the entire city, but Agent Hugo soon discovers there is even more at stake.\r\n\r\nThe game is played as a platformer with racing elements. Agent Hugo can use the R.I.S.K. Aquapolis boat with heat-seeking missiles and nitro acceleration. It can also dive and regular weapons can be used. While avoiding mines, the vessels can launch boomballs to blow up energy facilities, knock out enemies and open gates. Hugo can also swim and board other types of boats. On land, he has to either attack or sneak past enemies, with several disguises to stay undetected. When discovered, a meter starts to fill up. It can only be depleted by shaking off enemies and finding a hiding spot.\r\n\r\nDuring his mission Agent Hugo meets members of R.I.S.K, such as Agent 01 & 02, professor W, Ms Alltobright and Honeybunny. Villains include SUSPECTRA chief Dr Nogo and the local bosses of the districts: Kizzi Mi, Oddjaw and Max Schmertz.",

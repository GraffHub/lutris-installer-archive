  "description": "This is the Future... Mankind has mastered genetic engineering. Take control of a team of genetically modified warriors called GenoHunters and guide them through awe-inspiring worlds. Genos can adapt to any situation by mutating at will, acquiring new weapons and abilities as desired by absorbing DNA.\r\n\r\nYou have twelve organic worlds to explore. Weapons include fire breath, giant claws, electrical weapons, gene disruptors, necrocytes and flammable vomit.\r\n\r\nGo head to head in multiplayer matches (LAN and Internet) to see who has evolved the most effective set of warriors or exchange GenoHunters over the Internet.\r\n\r\nEvolva combines the excitement of a fast paced shoot-em-up with the tactical challenge of commanding a squad. Fight against the alien parasites and save the planet. This is survival of the fittest!\r\n\r\n*    Appealing scenery with an other-worldly feeling\r\n*    An unusual character development system based on mutations\r\n*    Use your GenoHunters' unique abilities to your advantage",

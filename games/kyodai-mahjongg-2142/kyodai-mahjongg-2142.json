  "description": "« Loading Kyodai Mahjongg for the first time is a revelation in how Mahjongg Solitaire games should be made. From the moment the soothing guitar music washes over you to your first look at the feature-packed but well organized interface, it's apparent that Kyodai Mahjongg is about escaping the real world and immersing yourself in a simple game.\r\nIn development since 1997, Kyodai Mahjongg has more than enough content to please the hungriest appetites, including eight fully realized Solitaire games, online multiplayer modes and dozens of tilesets and layouts. Kyodai Mahjongg is also a tweaker's dream, as the interface contains a wealth of visual and audio options, including the ability to switch between 2D and 3D graphics on the fly.\r\nEverything about Kyodai Mahjongg, including the superb artwork and the ability to create your own tilesets and layouts, is a testament to what one developer can accomplish over time with enough passion. »",

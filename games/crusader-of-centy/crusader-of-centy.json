  "description": "Crusader of Centy (also known as Soleil in Europe and Shin Sōseiki Ragnacënty (新創世紀ラグナセンティ, Shin Sōseiki Ragunasenti) (New Genesis: Ragnacënty) in Japan) is an action-adventure game that was released on the Genesis/Mega Drive. The story centers on Corona, a boy who has just turned 14 years of age and must inherit his late father's sword to fight the monsters that threaten the human race's existence. Gameplay uses an overhead perspective and focuses on exploring, battling enemies with a sword, and solving puzzles. As the story progresses, numerous animals join the hero and aid him. They are used in gameplay like weapons or tools, which often grant passage to previously inaccessible areas.",

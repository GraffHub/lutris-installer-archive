  "description": "Minesweeper is a puzzle game in which the player is presented with a board filled with mines, without knowing what fields they occupy. When the player clicks on a field a number appears on it, indicating how many mines are located in the fields nearest to it. The player then clicks on other fields, trying to avoid mines. If the player makes a mistake, the mine will explode and the game is over. The game features three difficulty levels, distinguished by the size of the board - the bigger the board, the higher the difficulty level.",

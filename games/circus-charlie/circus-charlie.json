Walk the tightrope. Hit the trampoline. And don't forget the Flying Trapeze \r\n\r\nAnd you're not just clowning around. There is big money on each stunt. Bonus bucks, too. P. T. Barnum sure never paid like this. Of course, Tom Thumb never had to work like this, either.\r\n\r\nKeep at it long enough , and maybe some day you can buy this circus. In the meantime, remember:\r\nThe Show must go on!",

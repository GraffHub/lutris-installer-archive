F-ZERO, an inter-galactic Grand Prix, uses machines that weigh more than a ton, reach dash speeds of over 500km/h and hover a mere twelve inches off the ground! Choose from the heroic Captain Falcon, or the suave, Dr. Stuart. Need more choices? Then try the sly alien, Pico or the not-so-honest Samurai Goroh, and race for inter-galactic fame and fabulous fortune in the F-ZERO Grand Prix.\r\n\r\n* Select from four individual F-ZERO racers.\r\n* Three difficulty levels, each with five courses.\r\n* Grand Prix and Practice modes.",

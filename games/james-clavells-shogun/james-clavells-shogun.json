  "description": "EXPERIENCE THE SWEEPING DRAMA AND POWER OF JAMES CLAVELL'S SHOGUN\r\n\r\nThe year is 1600. You are John Blackthorne, Pilot-Major of a privateering merchant ship and the first Englishman to set foot on Japanese soil. Thrust into the exotic culture of feudal Japan, you must rely on your wits and sheer physical strength to survive. As you are drawn into the political intrigue and teeming violence, your most basic beliefs and assumptions will be tested. Act with care: in a land where honor is valued above life itself, you make a wrong decision at your peril.\r\n\r\nIn this interactive adaptation, Dave Lebling - co-author of the enormously popular Zork series - captures all the drama and spellbinding style of James Clavell's matchless novel. Color graphics created in the exquisite style of 16th century Japanese court painters illustrate the unfolding saga. Infocom's new, friendlier parser understands more commands than ever. And if you ever need help, on-screen hints will lead you back to the action.",

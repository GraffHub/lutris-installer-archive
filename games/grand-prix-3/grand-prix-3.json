  "description": "Grand Prix 3 aims to be a complete simulation of the 1998 Formula 1 World Championship, and features all the tracks, teams and drivers. You can practice the racetracks (which is recommended to learn their layouts and work on car setup) or compete in single races or the full championship.\r\n\r\nEach race weekend has practice and qualification sessions, and the lengths of these can be customized, as can the skill level of the opposition drivers. There are 7 driving aids available, including automatic brakes and gears and an indestructibility option - as you race at higher skill levels, less and less of these are available.\r\n\r\nCar setup is done in precise detail, with the chance to change wing settings (trading off grip against straight-line speed), brake balances (affecting how the car handles under braking) and gear ratios (trading acceleration off against top speed), as well as more complicated ones like packers, dampers and the ride height - the manual explains it in considerable detail, as well as offering driving tips.\r\n\r\nBefore each race you choose your pit strategy and tire compound - those with better short-term grip wear out quicker, especially if your driving style is aggressive. Wet racing is included, which requires much more careful driving and shrewd strategic choices as to which type of tires to use and when to pit to change them.",

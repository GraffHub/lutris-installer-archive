  "description": "Gunfighters (working title) is an online multiplayer FPS sloet in the Old West with low poly graphics.\r\n\r\nThe game supports 12 player multiplayer and bots are supported both on and offline. The player count may be increased but the game needs to be stress tested first, and the current map isn't set-up well for 20+ bots.",

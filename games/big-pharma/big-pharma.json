  "description": "What if you had it in your power to rid the world of disease, to improve the lives of millions, to ease suffering and cure the sickâ€¦ and earn a tidy profit?\r\n\r\nAs the head of your own Pharmaceutical Conglomerate you have this power resting in your hands. Will you use it for good? Being totally altruistic may not be the best business plan. The uncomfortable truth (is there an ointment for that?) is that some remedies are more profitable than others and illness is good for business.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the world of Big Pharma!",

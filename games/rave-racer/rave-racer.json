  "description": "Rave Racer (レイブレーサー Reibu Rēsā) is an arcade racing game that was released by Namco on 16 July 1995. It runs on Namco System 22 hardware, and could be played by two people per cabinet for up to eight players total when up to four of them were linked together. It is the third (and last, until Ridge Racer V: Arcade Battle in 2000) arcade title in the Ridge Racer series and the follow-up to Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer 2.\r\n\r\nCompared to Ridge Racer 2, Rave Racer adds two new tracks as well as the ability to play the original two, various handling changes, force feedback steering, and improved car and racetrack graphics. Like Ridge Racer 2, Rave Racer featured a new soundtrack. The new tracks contain various side roads, but some of them take more time than others to complete a full lap of the track.\r\n\r\nIt was the first game to feature high resolution 3D texture mapping, a feature which was not seen on other platforms until the Dreamcast over three years later. Rave Racer ran at a resolution of 640x480 and 60 frames per second.\r\n\r\nA Microsoft Windows version was originally under development for NEC's PowerVR graphics processor, and was demonstrated in early 1996. However the game was cancelled, thus no games in the Ridge Racer series were released for PC's until Unbounded in 2012. A PlayStation version was announced later in 1996, but it too was cancelled.\r\n\r\nWhile there was never a home release, the game's exclusive tracks were later included in the PSP Ridge Racer game in 2004, also including some of its soundtrack in either original or remixed form.",

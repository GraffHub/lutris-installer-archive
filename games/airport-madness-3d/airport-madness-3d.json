  "description": "The seventh version of Airport Madness offers players a 3-dimensional air traffic control experience, from a control tower perspective. You get to sit in a virtual swivel chair, able to pan around the airport with the drag of your mouse. Choose good weather or bad, adjust the tower height to your preference, then do your best to manage jet traffic into and out of five different real-world airports, with more airports coming soon. Listen to human pilot voices as the aircraft obey your every command. Watch as the animated windsocks react to gusty winds. Scan your radar screens for potential conflicts between aircraft.",

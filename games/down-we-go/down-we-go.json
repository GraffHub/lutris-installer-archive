  "description": "Digger Dave, the greatest archeologist that has ever lived, has always been able to solve his problems with righteous violence and wanton homicide. But when he digs into a labyrinthine dungeon in search of a nebulous evil presence, he finds that identifying who can be trusted is as much a challenge as avoiding death at the hands of the dungeon's bizarre monstrosities. 'Down We Go!' is a gradual crescendo of manic FPS action, mistrust, and facepalming. A zany Roguelite/FPS/Adventure hybrid with funky tunes, a retro visual style, random generation, pumpkins, Mary Queen of Scots, and just a little bit of looting.",

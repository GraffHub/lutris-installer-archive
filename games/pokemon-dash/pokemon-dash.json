After players have passed each of the number of checkpoints in order, the course is completed. The stylus is used by moving the stylus in the direction you want Pikachu to run. Along with racing on the ground, there are races in the sky using balloons.[1] There are many different terrains such as mazestone paths, forests, beaches, water, swamp, and lava pools. Throughout the courses are power ups which allow the player to run on different terrains without slowing down.[2] Dash also features a training cup, which is given to players starting the game for the first time. After completing the training cup, the player has the chance to play in the Grand Prix Mode. There are five main cups to compete in GP mode. Dash also offers harder GP modes that can be unlocked, which put the player against a faster level of Pokémon. Each cup has five courses within its area.",

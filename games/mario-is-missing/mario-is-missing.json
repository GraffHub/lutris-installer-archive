But where is that mastermind of reptilian trouble doing his dastardly deeds? And what has he done with Mario??\r\n\r\nWelcome to Mario is Missing! Take a trek with your travel agent, Luigi, and see the world! Track down troublesome turtles. Figure out where in the world you are, and what on earth happened to Mario. If your grasp of geography is good enough, you’ll get the goods, stomp the hoods, and grab Mario out of Bowser’s ghastly guest house. A learning adventure that the whole family can share.\r\n\r\nThis is no Koopa stomping mayhem. It’s a fun way to learn about our world. In the game, you get to:\r\n\r\nExplore exotic cities\r\nSteer through streets with maps and a compass\r\nGet clues from friendly people\r\nRead pamphlets for famous landmarks\r\nRetrieve fun facts and figures from a computer database\r\nIdentify continents, countries, and cities to enlist Yoshi’s aid\r\nTake snapshots of your adventures… and rescue Mario!\r\n\r\nTo solve the adventure, reading is required.\r\n\r\nThe adventure begins unexpectedly as Mario steps right into Bowser’s trap.\r\n\r\nNavigate streets of unfamiliar cities, discover clues and return lost artifacts.\r\n\r\nOnce the city is set straight, Luigi snaps the perfect pic for his album of famous landmarks.\r\n\r\nUse the Globulator to help Yoshi find Luigi so they can complete their mission and rescue Mario!",

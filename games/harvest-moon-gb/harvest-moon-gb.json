  "description": "Wake up with the sun. Feed the chickens. Milk the cows. And, don't forget to go to the market...all before breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe Super NES classic Harvest Moon is now available for the Nintendo Game Boy with all of the charm of the original and many new surprises. Designed to reward hard work and smart decision-making, Harvest Moon GB is a unique blend of a role-playing and a farming simulation game. Since this game is compatible with the Game Boy Game Link, you can exchange animals and seeds with your friends to create your own unique ranch. Best of all, Harvest Moon GB offers a greater variety of characters, crops and animals to choose from, making each game's outcome more fun and less predictable. Oh no! You forgot to plow the fields. Looks like no dinner tonight.",

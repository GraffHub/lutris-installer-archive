  "description": "Compatible with PSP® (PlayStation®Portable), PlayStation®Vita and PlayStation®TV.\r\n\r\nMotorStorm® Arctic Edge takes the smash hit PLAYSTATION®3 racing series and gives it a wintry twist for PSP™, as the planet’s wildest off-roaders hit the frozen wastes of Alaska.\r\n\r\nBe sure to bring some warm clothes, because the adrenaline-packed action will take you to the icy heart of the Arctic, where 12 multi-route, reversible tracks have been carved out of the terrain. Ice, snow and screaming winds will do their best to shatter your chances of success and survival – and your rivals won’t be there to pick up the pieces. In fact, they’ll probably be gloating over them.\r\n\r\nFeaturing tons of extreme vehicles – including brand new Snow Cats and Snow Machines – MotorStorm® Arctic Edge is a high speed rock ‘n’ roll riot. Add fast and furious multiplayer racing to the mix – via Ad Hoc Mode or Infrastructure Mode – and you’ve got a reckless driving challenge where you’ll never race the same lap twice.\r\n\r\nDownload MotorStorm® Arctic Edge today and see what happens when off-road goes off-piste.",

  "description": "P.O.W. is a side-scrolling, beat 'em up game, which were typical during the time that it was created. The game play is simple. For the NES version of the game, the crosspad maneuvers the character in all directions. The 'A' button kicks and if equipped with a weapon it will utilize the weapon. The 'B' button is used for punching and if equipped with a rifle, the player can strike opponents. When both buttons are pressed simultaneously, the player unleashes a powerful flying kick. The usefulness of the punch in the arcade version has been called into question, since it drives the enemy soldier backward, possibly giving him a chance to get away and then return to the fight. In the attract mode in the arcade version, a machine gun becomes available to Snake much earlier than in actual gameplay, a fact that some might say smacks of false advertising.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be consensus that the video game music on the third stage of the arcade version is rather compelling and suitable to the action.",

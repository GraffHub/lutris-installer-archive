  "description": "Commander Keen Is Up To His \"Ears\" in Vegetable Combat!\r\nCommander Keen returns to your computer screen with a whole new adventure. Trapped in the land of Tuberia, where giant vegetables rule the day, the occasionally fearless Keen must fight his way across a dangerous (though nourishing) landscape. Along the way, vicious broccoli beasts, savage asparagus warriors, and a bushel of other leafy green nasties confront and challenge your progress —all commanded by King Boabus Tuber, the fiercest spud of all!\r\n\r\nTalk about a food fight! Can you survive the perils of Kumquat Chasm and the Melon Mines on your way to the final epic battle that awaits you at the forbidding Castle Tuberia? Your strategy and quick reflexes mean the difference between victory and a one way trip to the great salad bar in the sky!\r\n\r\nA stirring soundtrack (AdLib™ and Sound Blaster™ compatible), dazzling full color graphics, and plenty of arcade excitement make this a three course meal of a game. Oh, and don't forget to finish your veggies—before they finish you!",

Until, from within its very heart, the seed of corruption started to grow and darkness threatened to enshroud all of its islands and their inhabitants in ruin and desolation. To save the world from this catastrophic fate, you shall yield the magical powers of the very land itself by matching gemstones, using the mana from within them to summon a variety of magical Fairies to aid you in your battle against the malicious Darklings.",

Most scenarios were changed or redone, the graphics are brighter and the gameplay is faster. The characters can now perform three and four-hit combos. More voice-overs and a new introduction cut-scene were added.\r\n\r\nThree kinds of tournaments are now available: double elimination, single elimination and sudden death. One, four or eight players can join the tournaments, with the option of renaming their characters for customization.",

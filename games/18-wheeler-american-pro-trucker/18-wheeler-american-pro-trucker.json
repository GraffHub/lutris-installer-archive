  "description": "Keep on truckin' as you get behind the wheel of 20 tons of bone-shaking, road-churning metal in the PlayStation 2 console version of this classic arcade truck game. Your rig can combine with up to 10 different sets of trailers, each carrying every kind of load from logs and cars to even an oil tank; and you'll be hauling tail across 10,000 miles of highway, including stages in New York, California and everywhere in between. Beware of obstacles along the way though, whether it's other trucks and rival drivers taunting you over CB Radio, to treacherous mountain paths and cranes dropping girders in your path.",

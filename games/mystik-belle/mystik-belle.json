  "description": "Being a student of mystical arts is hard work, doubly so if you are Belle MacFae - a freshman student at Hagmore School of Magic. The teachers and the staff are mean, her friends are few, and her grades suck. Worst of all â€“ Belle has a tendency to be at exactly the wrong place at exactly the wrongest time. Like tonight, for example, when she stayed up late to practice her fire magic, but instead got framed for upsetting an ancient ritual. And what better way is there to punish an unlucky first-year student, than to charge her with an impossible task on the worst night of the year? Re-create the Walpurgisnacht Brew, or be expelled, and with all manner of spooks taking over the school, expulsion is starting to sound better by the minute.\r\n\r\nInspired by games like Slightly Magic, Puff in Dragonland, and the Dizzy series, Mystik Belle is a hybrid of a classic point-and-click adventure and a modern metroidvania.\r\n\r\nYou may experience all of the following while playing this game:\r\n\r\n*    Get hopelessly lost in the massive school building and its surrounding areas.\r\n*    Find items and solve inventory puzzles. Or just clog up your pockets with useless junk.\r\n*    Interact with other inhabitants of Hagmore. Learn clues, help them out, ruin their day with angry flies.\r\n*    Fight through hallways infested by over 60 unique monster types.\r\n*    Defeat 8 bosses.\r\n*    Learn new magical and not-so-magical abilities.\r\n*    Ogle at retina-burningly colorful pixel art.\r\n*    Punch Cthulhu in the face.",

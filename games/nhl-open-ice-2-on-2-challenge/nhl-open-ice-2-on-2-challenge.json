  "description": "NHL Open Ice 2 on 2 Challenge is a four-player ice hockey video game developed by Midway as an arcade title in November 1995. The game features 26 NHL teams, over 100 players, Chicago Blackhawks longtime announcer Pat Foley, and a gameplay style that can be best described as similar to the over-the-top play of Midway's own NBA Jam. Much like its hardcourt predecessor, Open Ice includes a number of secret characters, including dozens of Midway staff and hockey legend Gordie Howe, all without helmets. It is the first and only hockey game where players can use the licensed versions of Mr. Howe and Wayne Gretzky together on the same team.",

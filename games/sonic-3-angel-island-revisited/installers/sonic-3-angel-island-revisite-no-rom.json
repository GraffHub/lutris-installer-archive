  "notes": "You MUST have bought 'Sonic 3 & Knuckles' (for SEGA Mega Drive & Genesis Classics) from the Steam Store and then log into Steam during the installation process with that account you purchased the game on for this installer to work.\r\n\r\nYou will need to do parts of the process manually, however the steps will be made obvious to you once manual input is needed. Steam will also need to be installed by the user during the installation process as a prerequisite first.",

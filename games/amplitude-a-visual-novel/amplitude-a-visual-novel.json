This is how laws and morals are taught and enforced. While binding, the friendly personality of these devices ensures that they their permanent presence feels more like having a caring companion than a jailor.\r\n\r\nIt is in this world that you are born, raised... and killed. But your determination to live and finish your life's mission is too strong to diminish even after death, and it is with the aid of a mysterious otherworldly girl that you managed to return in the body of a dead teenager. To continue on, to unravel the secrets too dangerous to be learned. To avenge. If only this body was just yours to share.\r\n\r\nThis game contains content such as: strong language, blood, violence, disturbing content, mentions of suicide, partial nudity.

  "description": "Leader Board authors Bruce and Roger Carver tried their hand at tenpin bowling, in one of the game’s earliest recreations. The process of bowling the ball involves timing a succession of clicks to set the right angle, speed and curve, similarly to Leaderboard’s system. Three skill levels are provided – Kids level sets the speed and hook automatically, while Amateur has more margin for error with hook/slice than professional. The game is played from a plan view, with four other (empty) lanes visible. Single matches or a league structure can be played.",

  "description": "Kindness Coins was made in April 2013 for the Pulse Pounding Heart Stopping Jam, which instructed players to make a dating sim in a weekend! I decided to make a very short visual novel where you play as the character a dating sim protagonist is trying to win over. It was my first game and I'm still very proud of it, for as silly as it is.\r\n\r\nPlay time is around 5 - 10 minutes, depending on how fast you read! One entire ending! Windows, Mac, and Linux compatible! You can see the nice things people wrote about it here, and a post I wrote about making it here. Please have fun! Thanks for playing!",

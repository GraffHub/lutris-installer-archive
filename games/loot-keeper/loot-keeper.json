  "description": "Inventory management simulator gone roguelike! Are you one of those damn hoarders? Do you loot every single house on your way - as long, of course, as their owners don't see your dirty hands touching the cutlery? Well, this game is for you! But this time, you don't have unlimited inventory space. Try to fit all your crooked swords, magic shields and useless food items in the little space you have - all that in a randomized dungeon, with enemies out to get you! What's going to cause you the most trouble - a legendary skeleton mage or your beloved items?",

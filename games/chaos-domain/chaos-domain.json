  "description": "Chaos Domain is a game about shooting bad people in the face.\r\n\r\nApart from that, it is also a run and gun platformer, powered by Unreal Engine. The game is highly influenced by games from 8-bit and 16-bit era, including Contra/Probotector series, as well as titles like Abuse and Doom Troopers.\r\n\r\nThe game is set on a huge spaceship occupied by chaos cultists, where the main character (who clearly looks like a hi-tech version of the god Anubis) must kill everyone in sight. The game is obviously not story-driven, itâ€™s all about action.\r\n\r\nPlayers can upgrade weapons and purchase special items that can boost their performance. Local co-op for 2 players is available.",

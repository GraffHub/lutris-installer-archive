  "description": "Dual Universe is a Continuous Single-Shard sandbox MMORPG taking place in a vast fully editable Sci-Fi universe, focusing on emergent gameplay with player-driven in-game economy, politics, trade and warfare.\r\n\r\nThe first fully editable universe made for players by players.\r\nThe only limit is your imagination! Gather your friends and build on a truly epic scale.\r\n\r\nGround vehicles, ships, buildings, cities, space stationsâ€¦\r\nScript games inside the game, contraptions, puzzles and amazing interactive constructs, then blueprint them and sell them for profit, or hoard them for strategic advantage.\r\n\r\nDual Universe is the first game where potentially millions of players can interact together simultaneously, inside the same giant universe. We call it the continuous single shard.\r\n\r\nNo multi-server player separation, instances or loading times, just one enormous persistent universe that never stops. Everyone you meet is human and your social interactions will drive game play. What you do matters.\r\n\r\nWill you fight? Trade? Cooperate? Or betray one another?",

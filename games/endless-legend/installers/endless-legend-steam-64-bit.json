  "description": "Due to a regression in wine 2.19 through at least 2.21 Endless Legend currently needs a wine version which Lutris currently only provides for x86_64 (64 Bit) architecture. Since the game and the original installer supported i386 (32 Bit) architecture this installer installs Endless Legend into a 64 Bit Wine Steam prefix configured to use this specific wine version.",

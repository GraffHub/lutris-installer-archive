  "description": "battleMETAL is a successor to the 90's mech simulators of old. A delightful modernization of commanding giant robots bristling with firepower. Players choose and customize their war machines known as METALS, and then drop into the blighted world of Geiserat.\r\n\r\nNewest update is the ability to fight yer friends, or group up and smash some enemy metal. Cooperative and PvP play is now live in this build, and I'll be expanding on it through this version.\r\n\r\nPlayers will be tasked with completing a variety of mission types and they must choose the best mechs and weapons to complete their objectives. battleMETAL runs on the tried-and-true Quake engine via the Darkplaces source-port. Game features dynamic lighting, immersive HUDs, robust mech customization, and outdoor terrain.",

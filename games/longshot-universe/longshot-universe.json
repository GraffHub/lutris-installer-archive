  "description": "Longshot Universe is an arena shooter where you take control of a variety of space ships in the far reaches of space to fight it out with the opposing team.\r\n\r\nMuch like other MOBA style games you choose a ship and work to take out the enemy base. However, you build and customize your ship rather than picking from a predetermined set. Based on your choices you may end up with an agile fighter with access to special flight maneuvers or a large tank able to move in and take the punishment.\r\n\r\nWhile the game is three dimensional, the action takes place on three, two dimensional planes: a high, mid, and a low plane. The main game play loop is like other MOBA-style games where you must fight your way over to the enemy base and destroy it before the other team destroys yours. There is also a single player and co-op tower defense mode where you must defend your base against increasing hordes of the enemy.",

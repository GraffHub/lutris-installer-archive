Yet the cold-blooded murder of your dad is the crime they've locked you up for. Fueled by grief and a burning desire for vengeance, you must break out of jail to find the real culprit. It's payback time.\r\n \r\nThrough the fast-paced gameplay the player will discover the joy of top-down carnage with stunning 3D graphics and destructible environments, dramatic storytelling and epic car-chase mayhem.",

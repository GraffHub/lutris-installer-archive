  "description": "Here's a chance to replay your life again and again, each time with a different personality. This time around, you can be a wealthy entrepreneur who will do anything to get ahead. Or take on the life of a broke, but happy poet. Or fulfill your dream of being the most popular person in your high school with a date book filled up for the next five years.\r\n\r\nIn Alter Ego, YOU create the character you want to be -- your \"alter ego\" -- and then live your your alter ego's life from birth through old age. So be a kid again, get back at all those snobs from high school, do all those things Mom and Dad wouldn't let you do or go back and marry that long-lost love you let get away.\r\n\r\nWith Alter Ego, you play the game of LIFE.",

  "description": "EGGNOGG+, a competitive arcade game of immortals sword-fighting to the death.\r\n\r\nStab each other, hurl and ricochet your swords off of the walls and ceilings, engage in pugilism, jump over spike pits to make it past your eternal foe and reach the far end of the strange complex. Hurl yourself triumphantly, and finally, into the EGGNOGG.\r\n\r\nIncludes procedurally generated bytebeat tunes that you can edit live, and also create additional songs.\r\n\r\nCreated originally for the 2013 March TOJam as a re-imagining and parody of NIDHOGG (while awaiting the release of NIDHOGG).",

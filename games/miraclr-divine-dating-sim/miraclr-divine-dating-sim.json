  "description": "The archangels of Heaven are planning their first miracle on Earth in over four hundred years. In order to succeed, they need your help! Of course, humans can't visit Heaven while they are alive, so you're going to need some 21st-Century technology to give the angels your input. Join them in miraclr: Divine Dating Sim.\r\n\r\nmiraclr is a comedic workplace romance visual novel starring the biblical (and apocryphal) archangelsâ€”plus Lucifer!--told in an office collaboration app. The story takes place in real-time over one week as you help the angels decide upon, then execute, a divine miracle. Throughout each day, you will both meet with all the angels and receive private messages from individual angels, looking to win your favor. The PC release of miraclr also includes time skip, rewind, and day select features to let you play through in one session if you prefer.",

  "description": "Step right up to the ACRO-Battiest show on earth! The madman industrialist Edgar Equator has seized control of The World of Amusement. He and a deranged cast of fairground freaks threaten the circus. The only hope for survival is the high-flying, death-defying AERO THE ACRO-BAT! Spin-tingling terror unfolds as AERO tackles Equator's wicked henchmen. Bung jump into a battle with evil! Skydive in Mode 7 toward the danger below! Hang on for the ride of your life as you rise and plunge on a roaring roller coaster! Then power drill and twist AERO right through every sinister circus enemy imaginable. And all the while, the show must go on! It could become a carnival of carnage in the World of Amusement. Because the evil Equator isn't clowning around ... and there's nothing amusing about that.",

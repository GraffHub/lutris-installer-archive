  "description": "The inhabitants of Planet Bomber lived in peace, protected by five spirits, until the evil Bagulaa and his Robot Army approached via an artificial comet. The Spirit Pictures, the source of the spirits' magical power, were destroyed, splitting Planet Bomber into five pieces. Bomberman must reassemble the Spirit Pictures in each area in order to restore Planet Bomber to the way it was, all the while defeating the Robot Army. This time, Bomberman's companion Louie can provide a helping hand.",

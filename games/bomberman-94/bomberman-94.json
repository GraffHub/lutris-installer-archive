The Spirit Pictures, the source of the spirits' magical power, were destroyed, splitting Planet Bomber into five pieces. Bomberman must reassemble the Spirit Pictures in each area in order to restore Planet Bomber to the way it was, all the while defeating the Robot Army. This time, Bomberman's companion Louie can provide a helping hand.",

  "description": "The year is 2020. After an environmental holocaust of devastating proportions, the population hovers slightly above the zero mark. The rich have fled underground, where they have formed corporate enclaves. Above ground, the desolate cities and desert wastelands are inhabited by a feral population of freaks and survivors. With 98% of the population dead there's a lot of cars around just waiting to get driven into the ground. The ferals started the Powersliding competition, the corporates banned it. It's dangerous, it's illegal, it kicks butt.\r\n\r\nPowerslide is the off-road racing game that makes its own damn track. Through the punishing post-apocalyptic terrain and abandoned, ghostly cityscapes, brutal alpine tracks and icy roadways. You’ll be torching the tundra. Scorching the Savannah. Leaping over canyons. Surfing mud-slides and braving perilous urban and outdoor environments. You’ll be feeding the off-road speed demon within.\r\n\r\n* 8 treacherous off and on-road tracks plus 4 bonus tracks!\r\n* Superior AI realistically simulates human treachery, speed, and killer cunning!\r\n* Realistic physics modeling 6 degrees of limitless freedom lets you overcome any obstacle!",

  "description": "Implode is a homebrew puzzle game. It plays like a falling block puzzle in all respects, with the exception of the fact that the blocks appear from below instead of falling. All the blocks have the same shape and are only distinguished by their color. The player must selects groups of three or more identically colored blocks in order to make them disappear. The goal is to not let the blocks stack up and pass the upper border of the screen. Bombs would sometimes appear and clear out adjacent blocks if the player selects them. The game gradually advances to higher difficulty levels, with more colors and faster speed.",

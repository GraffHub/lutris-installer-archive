There is actually a different page presented for this version for a different steamid, note that there is a line on the store page stating that this is the version with Japanese support (お知らせ: このバージョンのゲームは日本語を含みます。); even though there is still no support stated in the usual place for language support.\r\n\r\nThe grass and other types of foliage seem to only appear when you are standing in them but everything else renders right.",

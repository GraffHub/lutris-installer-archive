  "description": "While taking a well earned break from bombing, Bomberman finds himself being sucked into a black hole, created by Rukifellth's gravity generators. It seems the evildoer uses the gravity generators to enslave planets, while hoping to find one of seven powerful stones by which he plans to rule the planet with.\r\n\r\nCombining puzzle solving with the classic Bomberman bomb-and-run gameplay, the game gives you control on Bomberman with the mission of destroying the gravity generators ending Rukifellth's plans.",

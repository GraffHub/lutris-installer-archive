  "description": "With its high-value team objectives, limited range projectiles, and intense maneuvering, Paintball 2 offers a very unique experience that will appeal to both hardcore and novice players.  It only takes one shot to eliminate somebody, but the fast-paced, arcade-style movement from Quake 2 allows for quick dodging, insane jumps, and breakneck speeds.  Best of all, the game is completely free, and it's a small download, so just try it out!",

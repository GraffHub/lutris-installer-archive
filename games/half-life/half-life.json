  "description": "They're not just chasing you.\r\nThey're hunting you.\r\nJust another day at the office. Or so you thought...until your experiment blew up in your face. Now, with aliens coming through the walls, a military death squad killing everything in sight, and your colleagues in bits and pieces, you're scrambling to stay alive. Where should you go? Who can you trust? And can you figure it all out before they scrape you into a body bag?\r\n\r\nEnemy Teamwork\r\nIt isn't your imagination. These guys are working together. They'll lay down cover fire, flank you and use grenades to flush you out.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary Realism\r\nMonsters have the most fluid and intricate motion ever seen in an action game, thanks to Half-Life's skeletal animation system.\r\n\r\nScripted Sequences\r\nThis interrogation is getting out of hand. You can watch this scientist die or come to his aid -- he may return the favor later on.\r\n\r\nWorldcraft 2.0 Included\r\nCreate your own custom Half-Life levels with Worldcraft 2.0, the most popular level editor available.\r\n\r\nNew To Action Games?\r\nUse the training room to build your skills. And multiplayer games are just a click away with Half-Life's easy-to-use interface.",

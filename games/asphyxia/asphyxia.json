  "description": "Samantha is depressed. She’s been depressed for a long time, almost as long as she can remember, but it’s slowly been getting worse.\r\nShe thought Lillian was her friend, her best friend. Perhaps she even thought of her as more than that.\r\nWhy, then, did their relationship have to fall apart? Was it really her fault? She didn’t do anything wrong. At least, she didn’t intend to.\r\nNow, three months later, Samantha finally has her chance. Forced together on their geography field trip to the Lake District, will she finally be able to repair her relationship with Lillian – or will it collapse all over again?",

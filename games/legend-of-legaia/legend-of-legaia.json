  "description": "A strange mist blankets the world of Legaia. It has brought madness and rage to all it touches. To survive, the people live on the outskirts of civilization. They thought they were safe from the Seru creatures, which have been changed into killers by the mist. Unfortunately, they were wrong. Still, there is hope. In the town of Rim Elm, a young man named Vahn has bonded with a food Seru. With the help of some new friends, Vahn sets off to restore the seven genesis trees--the only hope left for Legaia.",

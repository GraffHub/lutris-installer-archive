  "description": "The year is 927 A.D. (as mortals reckon time) and the Almighty ODIN has summoned you, his faithful and heroic son, to The Great Hall of Asgard. Armed with only your enchanted hammer and considerable wits, you must journey to Midgard and destroy Jormangund!\r\n\r\nGod of Thunder was written by Ron Davis in 1993. It was never given much of a chance in the shareware market due to lack of funding, so this great game remains very rare. God of Thunder's unique combination of strategy and arcade action on the PC make it a classic favorite.",

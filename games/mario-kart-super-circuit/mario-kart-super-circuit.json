  "description": "This GBA conversion brings together elements of both Super Mario Kart (the original SNES classic) and the N64 sequel, Mario Kart 64.\r\n\r\nMuch like the SNES title, you can collect coins lying on the tracks to boost the speed of your kart.\r\n\r\nAll of the characters from MK64 are included (Mario, Luigi, Toad, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Wario, Peach, and Yoshi)\r\n\r\nNo Kart game is complete without a multiplayer mode. In this case, four can play classic and battle modes using either one cartridge and four GBA's or four cartridges and four GBA's for the full list of characters to choose from.\r\n\r\nWeapons include the classic green and red shells and the purple spiked shell.\r\n\r\n20 new tracks, using elements from both past titles.",

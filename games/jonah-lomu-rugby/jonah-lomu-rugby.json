  "description": "He's rough, tough and certainly the biggest thing in world rugby - Codemasters is proud to announce the signing of Jonah Lomu, the New Zealand All-Black's star performer, for it's rugby video game entitled Jonah Lomu Rugby.\r\n\r\nLomu, known as \"The Human Rhino\" in respect of his immense power, will star in the company's multi-player, 3D motion-captured video game, to be published on the Sportsmaster label, scheduled to appear on PlayStation and Saturn in November.\r\n\r\nWith Jonah Lomu headlining the game, players are guaranteed hard hitting, fast-paced rugby action. Played on a world stage, Jonah Lomu Rugby features 32 international teams, including New Zealand, England, France and Japan competing in international competitions. Players can run, tackle, kick, scrum-down and get down-right dirty in a variety of competitions including `Friendly', `Knockout', `League' and `Cup/Trophy'.\r\n\r\nJonah Lomu Rugby not only features the speed of backward play but, unlike previous rugby games, authentically incorporates the more powerful and aggressive - even violent - style of forward play where the crowded, all-in rucks, mulls and scrums form action highlights.\r\n\r\nThe game's design enables the \"pure game play\" to shine through. A finely- tuned learning curve ensures the game is instantly playable yet offers a level of unparalleled depth to deliver long-term riotous rugby entertainment.",

Alfred must battle his way through to rescue Billy Egg who has been \"poached\" by the fowl Meka-Chickens for their bizarre cloning \"eggs-periment\". Alfred, the all round good egg, must stop their evil bid to take over the world but surely he is up to the task. After all, he's not chicken. is he?\r\n\r\nThe game is a simple platformer and the remake of the gameboy version.",

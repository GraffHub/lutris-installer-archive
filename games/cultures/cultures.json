  "description": "Before Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492, the Vikings set out on their own journey of discovery and possible looting and pillaging. Having accidentally stumbled upon the Americas, they began their remarkable adventure in a new and unfamiliar land. Welcome to Cultures, where you can actively shape the destiny of your people as they struggle to gain a foothold on unfamiliar shores. Success hinges on your ability to balance achieving your goals with the needs and desires of your clan. It is up to you to nurture and guide your people: determine their names, occupations, marital partners, and, eventually, the gender of their children. The happiness of your settlers is paramount to achieving your goals in this exploration and construction-focused RTS.",

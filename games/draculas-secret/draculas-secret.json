  "description": "Dracula's Secret is targeted towards kids and young gamers. In the beginning of the game Dracula invites you to explore his castle and its surroundings in order to discover the hidden secret. As you start, you explore the environment around the castle and try to make your way inside. There are many hurdles on the way, but the main objective is to gain access and find what the secret hidden by Dracula is. The castle is surrounded by many different monsters, a cemetery, a broken bridge...\r\n\r\nOnce inside, you will meet different creatures and will have to solve puzzles. The objective is to find the items that comprise Dracula's Coat of Arms. The puzzles and obstacles include a range of logic-type problems and a few small games. There are fourteen or fifteen of these, including a couple of mazes, a picture puzzle, a sliding tile puzzle. The game uses a 1st-person perspective and Dracula appears at regular intervals to taunt your progress.",

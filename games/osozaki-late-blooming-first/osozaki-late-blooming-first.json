  "description": "Late Blooming is a romantic comedy about drama and tragedy set in Thais, a quiet little town lost in the world. You will have to play the role of the protagonist, an ordinary young man whose life has given him a second chance. Your mission will be to guide the protagonist in his decisions, and figure out the mysteries that hide inside the hearts of the three girls.\r\n\r\nAs in real life, our efforts can have unintended consequences; in the same way, Late Blooming incorporates a modality of decision that requires a much deeper analysis than simply choose a girl and wait for the desired event. Many decisions will require a choice between different moral values of equal caliber, or between different types of love: fraternal, romantic and sensual.",

Bowser hasn't been causing too much trouble, so Mario and his friends have decided to take a trip to the golf course. Waialae Country Club wouldn't allow a couple of underdressed plumbers to become members, so they've come up with their own golf game for Nintendo 64.\r\n\r\nMario Golf 64 features an all-star line up of 16 golfers from Nintendo's cast of video game celebrities, including incredibly realistic renditions of Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach. Each golfer has an individual set of strengths and weaknesses. One of the highlights of Mario Golf 64 is a special Time Attack Mode where players must compete to finish a round of golf as quickly as possible. We'd like to see them try that on the PGA Seniors' Tour.\r\n\r\nMario Golf 64 features an impressive line-up of six courses, which means you have to master a total of 108 holes. An optional Club Handicap Mode ensures that you stay close to the competition, so Luigi won't get too frustrated if he falls behind. Even though the golfers are far from realistic, the physics are as authentic as possible. The CPU calculates the exact ball movement based on wind direction, the strength of the strike, and any spin you choose to place on the ball.\r\n\r\nFun for one to four players, Mario Golf is an incredibly deep game with unbeatable replay value.

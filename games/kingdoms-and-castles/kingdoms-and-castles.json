  "description": "Kingdoms and Castles is a game about growing a kingdom from a tiny hamlet to a sprawling city and imposing castle.\r\n\r\nYour kingdom must survive a living and dangerous world. Do the viking raiders make off with your villagers? Or are they stopped, full of arrows, at the castle gates? Does a dragon torch your granary, your people dying of starvation in the winter, or are you able to turn the beast back? The success of your kingdom depends solely on your skill as a city and castle planner.",

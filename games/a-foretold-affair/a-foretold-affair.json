  "description": "Buffalo Seer is an eccentric Abnormal who wants nothing more than to use the magic ability within them: future seeing. However, even within their society where everyone has a special power, future seeing is considered dangerous and advised against.\r\n\r\nUnable to be swayed, Seer finally gains permission to look into their own future, only to receive an unbelievable revelation. Not only have they left Abnormal society, they're married to someone they've never met before.\r\n\r\nWith visions of happiness in their mind, Seer leaves everything behind and ventures to the part of the land fraction where those without magic live: Normal society.\r\n\r\nSeer is going to convince this stranger that they are meant to be together no matter what it takes, even if it means tagging along on an adventure.\r\n\r\nIn only a few days Seer will learn just how far away that pleasant future is.",

  "description": "Welcome to Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker, by far and away the finest computer-based snooker simulation in world. Jimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker adheres to the rules of real snooker, and the balls obey the laws of physics to the letter.\r\n\r\nJimmy White's Whirlwind Snooker allows one or two players to practice against each other, set up and perform trick shots or compete against one another or four increasingly challenging computer controlled opponents (one of whom is Jimmy White himself), and plenty more besides!\r\n\r\n\"This knocks everything else into touch. The ball movement's fantastic and everything in the real thing is here - in fact, there are shots you can't do in the real thing. It's like being there, under the light. The only difference is your fingertips don't get to touch the cue or the table.\" Jimmy White - World class snooker player",

  "description": "Dig Dug 2, subtitled Trouble in Paradise for Bandai's American NES port, is the arcade sequel to Dig Dug, released by Namco in 1985. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy, The Tower of Druaga and Grobda (without the DAC). The only home version of the game was for the NES, which Bandai released in Japan on April 18, 1986, and in North America during 1989.",

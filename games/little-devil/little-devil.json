  "description": "Little Devil  surrounds main character Phip-an awkward vulture kid who has a crush on his classmate, Blair. After Blair goes missing for a week, Phip finds a decomposing hand in the middle of the woods, and hes almost certain it belongs to her! When Phip brings her back to life, he is sure they will become friends and arrest her killer..........But we don't care about Phip and what he wants! We want Blair and pretty colors and murder and that's exactly what this game is about!\r\n\r\nThere are a total of 7 different endings and multiple choices to reflect that! I'd recommend saving in between choices so you can load after a bad end :}",

  "description": "Makoâ”€the lifeblood of the planet and the fuel that powers the city of Midgar...\r\n\r\nBy exploiting this resource through their Mako Reactors, the Shinra Electric Power Company has all but seized control of the entire world. A ragtag group of idealists, known as Avalanche, are one of the last bastions of resistance.\r\n\r\nCloud, an elite SOLDIER operative turned mercenary, takes part in an Avalanche operation to destroy Mako Reactor 1 in the city of Midgar.\r\n\r\nThe bombing plunges the city into fiery chaos, and amidst the raging inferno, Cloud is tormented by visions of a bitter enemy long thought dead.\r\n\r\nAfter this hallucination fades, he meets a young woman selling flowers, who offers him a single yellow blossom.\r\n\r\nIn that instant, a host of swirling shadows surround them.\r\n\r\nOnce more begins a story that will shape the destiny of an entire world.",

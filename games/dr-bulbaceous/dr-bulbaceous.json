  "description": "Descend through 100 levels of challenging puzzle mayhem in a quest to defeat the big bad boss at the bottom of the bottom most well. Fans of Uo Poko, Puzzle Bubble and Bust-a-move will enjoy Dr. B or be prosecutedt to the full extent of the jam.\r\n\r\n As Dr. B, you have the official task of cleaning the wells of Bulbville by matching 3 or more bulbs of the same colour. If you play well, you get Cookies that allow you to \"cheat\" by buying strange balls from the Swap Shop but by using these balls to clear a well, you get less cookies for each level cleared. What do you do?!\r\n\r\n There is, of course, an end of level boss waiting for you down the dankest level of the 100th well but don't tell them I said that!",

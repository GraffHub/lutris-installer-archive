  "description": "Gruniożerca 2 is a puzzle-platformer for the NES developed by Łukasz Kur\r\n& M-Tee between November 2017 and January of 2018.\r\nIn it, you control Grunio, pet and guinea pig mascot of arhn.eu, on a quest to\r\nfind his owner, gaming personality Dark Archon, who has gotten lost in the\r\ndepths of their overly complex cellar.\r\nLuckily, Grunio’s chew toys have been strewn all throughout the house, the\r\ncellar being no exception. So, help this piggie place blocks, swing squeaky\r\nhammers, push stools, press switches, collect keys, devour carrots, leap,\r\nclimb, teeter, and tumble his way through 24 dark, dingy, and drab basement\r\ndoors.",

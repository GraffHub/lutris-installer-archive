  "description": "An obsolete video game for a dark passage of history\r\n\r\nThe plot: In the 13th century, the Cathars, who preach about good Christian beliefs, were being expelled by the Catholic Church out of the Languedoc region in France. One of them, called Jean Raymond, found an old church in which to hide, not knowing that beneath its ruins lay buried an ancient evil.\r\n\r\nThe game: Faith will be your only weapon in this platformer styled like a Spectrum ZX game. Black backgrounds, one color sprites and 1 bit sounds are a proper fit with the story, because the lack of details force imagination to do its magic.\r\n\r\nInfluences: l'Abbaye des Morts is inspired by the tragic history of the Cathars and styled in the line of Manic Miner, Jet Set Willy and other British Platformers from the Spectrum computers.\r\n\r\nPersonal note: This little game has been created at nights during our vacation in southern France. It's like a jam straight out of our feelings in the Languedoc. It has been ported to many platforms, but it was in 2013 when it finally landed on the real Spectrum ZX as a cassette game :-)\r\n\r\nStories: People consider l'Abbaye des Morts a cult title between my games. It has been open sourced and ported to many platforms, one of them being the real Spectrum ZX.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\n*    Look and feel close to Spectrum ZX games.\r\n*    16 colors palette (1 color per sprite) and 1 channel monophonic music (using only square wave form).\r\n*    23 screens to explore.\r\n*    30 minutes of gameplay.\r\n*    Riddles and hints to find items.\r\n",

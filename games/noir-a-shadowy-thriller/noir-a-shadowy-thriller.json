  "description": "It was one of those steamy summer nights in the City of Angels and Jack Slayton was nowhere to be found. Wasn’t like Jack to disappear for days without so much as a word. Hope he hadn’t crossed paths with some jealous dame, coming face-to-face with the wrong end of a revolver. Only one way to find out – sift through his case files in hopes of discovering who might want him out of the picture.\r\n\r\nNoir takes you back to 1940 Los Angeles in a shadowy detective thriller created entirely in dramatic black and white. A simple point-and-click interface takes you through six unsolved cases, ranging from wartime espionage to the underground lairs of Chinatown, from the seductive excesses of Hollywood to the smoke-filled deceit of the nightclub underworld.",

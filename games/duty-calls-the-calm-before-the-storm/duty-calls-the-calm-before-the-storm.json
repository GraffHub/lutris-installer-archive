  "description": "To underscore how Bulletstorm puts the fun back in the gun, EA is releasing parodies that poke fun at some of today's most serious shooters. First was the \"Last Call\" video that spoofed Halo's famous commercial. Today they're back with a fully playable FREE downloadable game that takes on some of today's most popular shooters. \r\n\r\nDuty Calls \"features\": \r\n* Duty Vision slows down the action so you can unload a storm of bullets \r\n* Immersive dialogue from the front lines \r\n* Cold, calculated realism \r\n* Killing animations motion captured from real actors \r\n* True-life reloading system allows for mistakes in putting the cartridge in the gun \r\n* Iconic sound effects \r\n* Thwart an enemy threat that could topple the country and possibly the world \r\n* Significant and historically accurate props",

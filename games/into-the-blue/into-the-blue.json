  "description": "But while it is true that “Into the Blue” and “Tetris Attack” play very similarly, it is still not correct to call “Into the Blue” a “Tetris Attack” clone. Actually, “Into the Blue” is based on a game that is even a few years older than “Tetris Attack” and features slightly different game mechanics. That game, a Sega Genesis title by the name of “Megapanel”, is widely forgotten today – probably because it was never released on any other systems and never made its way out of Japan.",

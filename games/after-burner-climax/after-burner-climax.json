  "description": "After Burner Climax (アフターバーナー クライマックス) is a combat flight video game developed and published by Sega.[7] The game is a part of the After Burner series, and was first released in arcades in 2006 and was later ported to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in April 2010.[8]\r\n\r\nLike previous incarnations of After Burner, the \"Deluxe\" After Burner Climax cabinet has a servo-equipped chair; a new function is a button that locks the chair into a static upright position. Two other cabinet versions include a \"Commander\" version, which only tilts side to side, and the \"Standard\" version, which doesn't move at all. The \"Deluxe\" version cabinet has a widescreen LCD monitor, while the \"Standard\" and \"Commander\" models have a 29\" CRT.\r\n\r\nThe game was delisted from both Xbox Live and PSN in December 2014,[9] and was removed from the mobile storefronts in May 2015.[10] However, the mobile version was re-released via the Sega Forever service in April 2019.[11]",

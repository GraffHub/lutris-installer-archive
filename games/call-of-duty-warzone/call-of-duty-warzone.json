Part of the Call of Duty franchise, Warzone was developed by Infinity Ward, Raven Software and published by Activision. Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150 players set in the fictional city of Verdansk. The game is a spin off of the 2019 title Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and features both cross-platform play and cross-platform progression between both games.\r\n\r\nThe game features two modes, Plunder and Battle Royale. The game introduces a new in-game currency system called Cash which is used at Buy Stations in and around Verdansk.

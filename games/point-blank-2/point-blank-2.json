  "description": "The ultimate G-Con45 game is back, as Dr Don and Dr Dan return in an all-new sharp-shooting frenzy from Namco. Created exclusively for PlayStation, Point Blank 2 features even more crazy galleries with literally thousands of targets flying off in all directions. Shooting galleries galore, plus a new adventure game mode for the daring doctors, AND the madcap Party mode, specifically designed for team playing.\r\n\r\nNot only does this version give you more stages and a new original mode, but it has more gripping gameplay, and is not to be missed! No special technique is required to play, and because it is easy to pick up and play for a few minutes, it is perfect to play with a crowd of friends.",

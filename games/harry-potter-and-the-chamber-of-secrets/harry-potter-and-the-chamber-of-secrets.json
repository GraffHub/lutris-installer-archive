  "description": "The second Harry Potter role-playing game follows directly on from the first, with mostly the same game mechanics, controls and even some of the graphics.\r\n\r\nTo unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, young wizard Harry Potter must fight turn-based battles and solve quests. In this game, he is not alone, as a party system was added: his friends Ron and Hermione (and some other characters) will join Harry in the battles. While Harry (as in the previous game) can use card combinations of Famous Witches and Wizards cards to produce special attacks and effects, his friends have other means: Ron can unleash his rat Scabbers in special rat attacks and Hermione, being the know-it-all that she is, influences combat through \"lecture attacks\", using helpful hints like \"Be Careful!\" (which increases defense, for example).\r\n\r\nLike the first game, this one also includes several mini-games, including Quidditch, that once found in the game can be accessed from the main menu.",

  "description": "Dejection is a short story set in late 1790s Britain. It tells the tale of two young poets, Samantha and Lillian, as they struggle with their careers, writer's block, depression, and - most of all - their relationship with each other.\r\n\r\nSamantha and Lillian are based on Coleridge and Wordsworth, respectively, who were English poets who were alive in the 18th century. The VN is fairly historically accurate (though neither poet was a cute girl in real life, sadly). Given they were both Romantic poets, expect a lot of angst.",

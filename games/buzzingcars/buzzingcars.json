  "description": "BuzzingCars is a totally crazy racing game where you'll not only need to be fast but also smart. You must carry out various missions such as drive robots around, chase flying saucers, electrocute aliens and of course race against the clock.\r\nAn original bonus system prevents you from getting stuck in the game : even if a mission just happens to be too much, you can move on to another one.",

  "description": "Battles are the aim of the game here, as the crazy critters, more commonly known as Pokémon, return to the N64.\r\n\r\nOnce again, you have the option of building a team of battle ready warriors for a range of battles against other Pokémon trainers. Along the way, you will get the chance to fight for a range of Poké-cups, or take your Pokémon for a ride to a collection of mini-games for bonus prizes (or just for the fun of it).\r\n\r\n4 players can compete in the one tournament, while the transfer pak allows you to upload your Pokémon that you have from the range of Pokémon Game Boy Games (including the original Pokémon Red and Blue, and the GBC Gold/Silver series). If you don't have the Game Boy games, you can choose from a selection of Pokémon straight out of the box to get into the fight without mucking around.",

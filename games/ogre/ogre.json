  "description": "Stop The Ogre In Its Tracks\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenge the Ogre, a cybernetic supertank programmed to coldly annihilate anything in its path. Set on 21st century battlefields, this game of strategy is for either one or two players.\r\n\r\nConventional forces such as nuclear-armed tanks, speed vehicles, howitzers and infantry must be skilfully deployed to defend a command post. The composition and placement of units is critical in destroying the Ogre which has multiple weapon systems and trick armour plating.\r\n\r\nOgre is an adaption of the classic board game by Steve Jackson. It epitomizes simplicity and play balance, yet is far from simple to win. A game editor allows computer warriors to design their own wasteland battlefields, ensuring long-term player appeal.\r\n\r\n    1-2 player strategy game\r\n    Numerous programmed playfields\r\n    Facility to design unlimited original playfields\r\n    Various Ogre skill levels\r\n    Menu driven for ease of use\r\n    Superb sound effects\r\n    1-2 hours of playing time",

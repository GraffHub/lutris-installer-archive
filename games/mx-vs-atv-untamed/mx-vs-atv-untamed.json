  "description": "MX vs. ATV(tm) Untamed kicks it up a notch and shifts into high gear as the best selling offroad franchise returns. Rainbow Studios has evolved their legendary Rhythm Racing(tm) engine to include throttle based power slides, near upside down whips and new scrubs at full speed all while retaining the smooth and authentic feel not found in any other game.\r\n\r\nAttempt to own the offroad by dominating the innovative new \"X-Cross Tournament.\" X-Cross brings together 8 unique racing series like Endurocross, Opencross, Supercross, Waypoint and SuperMoto and then crosses them into one ultimate offroad championship. Brand new styles of racing are born as powerful vehicles tear through treacherous trails in the new Opencross mode, while then shifting gears to navigate boulders, logs, and water pits in Endurocross.\r\n\r\nPlayers can take control of the new ORV Sport and multiple other vehicles, including Monster and Trophy Trucks, as they blitz through rough rivers, rip though swampy everglades, and blaze through the desert dunes. Amp up your favorite vehicles' power, handling, and acceleration with more than 100 sponsor parts and accessories.\r\n\r\nThe MX vs. ATV rivalry explodes as the top professional riders go bar-to-bar in Supercross, Outdoor Nationals, Supermoto, and Freestyle showdowns.",

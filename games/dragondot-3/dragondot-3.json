  "description": "Be a dragon! Lay waste to your foes with your claws, bite, and fire breath! Gather gold and bring it back to your lair to grow in power! Bask in the adoration of your kobold followers! (Also you're a circle for some reason. This is Dragondot 3, you should be used to that by now.)\r\n\r\nAn action-adventure game full of secrets to find and new abilities to gain, drawing inspiration from the Legend of Zelda series among others. Map exploration, skills gained, and hoard stockpiled are all saved persistently, so you can continue your adventure across multiple sessions. Featuring over twenty different types of creatures to encounter, over twenty different skills to acquire (some with multiple upgrade levels), over a hundred map screens to explore (not even counting the dungeons, tunnels, and secret caves)! It's the deepest Dragondot adventure to date, all packed into a single cozy little PICO-8 cartridge.",

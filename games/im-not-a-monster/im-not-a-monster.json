  "description": "A tourist starship is under invasion by monsters. They take human form and are picking off the passengers one by one. The bravest civilians take up arms and fight back. But first they must figure out who are the monsters.\r\n\r\nEach pvp session features a group of up to six players, where every player is randomly assigned the role of civilian or monster, with a max. of two monsters.\r\n\r\nIf you are a civilian:\r\n•Trust no one. Suspect everyone.\r\n•Watch out: infected by a monster, civilians have just a few moves to heal, or they turn into monsters themselves.\r\n•Check the boxes around the starship for weapons and tools.\r\n•Combine loot to gain a unique ultimate ability that you can use to turn the tide of battle.\r\n\r\nIf you are a monster:\r\n•Learn your enemies' strategy and adapt to it.\r\n•Take part in conversations and gain civilians' trust.\r\n•Infect the passengers to respawn if you are disclosed and killed.\r\n•Infect the civilians to turn them into ones of your own.",

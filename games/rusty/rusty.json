  "description": "Hundreds of years ago, the ruler of Transylvania, a man by the name of Monte Carlo, was sealed away by the soul of a lone sacrifice. However, that seal has, over the centuries, begun to weaken, and recently a great number of monsters have started to appear around the land. Young girls have started disappearing from the villages in the area, but there are whispers of one from afar who may be able to bring them safely back. A young girl named Rusty appears in one of the villages, seeking the source of the monsters. Two young children, whose sister was taken by the monsters, ask Rusty to save her, and she heads straight on, whip in hand.\r\n\r\nRusty is a side-scrolling action platformer that is noticeably similar to the well-known Castlevania series. Controlling the titular whip-wielding vampire hunter, Rusty, the player must enter the cursed land of Transylvania, defeating a variety of evil monsters, and searching for the missing girls. Throughout each stage are locked doors which require keys in order to open, and Rusty can also run as well as swing from hooks using her whip. There are also items strewn about each stage which will give her access to special super-attacks, as well as an owl companion which will attack enemies for her.",

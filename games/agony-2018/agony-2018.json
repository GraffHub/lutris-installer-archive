  "description": "Please bear in mind that Agony is quite an \"old school\" game; non-linear, with a semi-open world, a lot of different paths, endings, exploration possibilities as well as secrets to uncover. Playing Agony is notably different than what you can get from modern, mostly linear and corridor-style ho\r\n\r\nSTORY MODE\r\n\r\nYou will begin your journey as a tormented soul within the depths of hell, without any memories about your past.\r\n\r\nThe special ability to control people on your path, and even possess simple minded demons, gives you the necessary measures to survive in the extreme conditions you are in.\r\n\r\nBy exploring the hostile environment and interacting with other weary souls of the hellscape, the hero will soon understand that there is only one way to escape from Hell, and it will require meeting the mystical Red Goddess.\r\n\r\nAGONY MODE\r\n\r\nAgony features a full-fledged story mode as well as an open challenge system that\r\nrandomly generates levels for players to explore and survive to gain new Highscores. In\r\naddition to featuring in countless “Most anticipated Horror Games 2018” lists, the kick\r\nstarter financed title is set to challenge players with its brutal and malevolent\r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\nAgony throws you in the midst of hell where you strive to stay alive\r\nand solve the riddle behind the mysterious Red Goddess; architect of this place of sorrow\r\nand pain, and the sole entity with knowledge of how escape… but there is more to the\r\nstory than it seems. Haunted by nightmare creatures, You will gain the ability to possess\r\ndemons and other souls to find a way out of hell.",

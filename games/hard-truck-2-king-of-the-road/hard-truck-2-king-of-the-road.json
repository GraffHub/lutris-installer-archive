It's all in a days work when you're driving the big rigs. From small trucks to 18 wheelers, you'll pilot the cabs that keep this country truckin'. Bid on jobs, manage your money, and keep on the right side of John Q. Law if you want to succeed in this racket.\r\nCheck this out...\r\n\r\n    12 Different Trucks including 18 wheel big rigs.\r\n    Speed traps with police car chases and helicopter pursuits.\r\n    Special effects like exhaust, tire marks, fog and blinding sun.\r\n    Race the clock as day becomes night right before your eyes.\r\n    Over 70 miles of continuous roads and secret path!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you're not on the job, race other rig-masters in time trails, obstacle courses, and one-on-one track racing. This is no wimpy race car sim! So, hop into yor cab, fire up your engine and put the pedal to the metal! The open road is calling you.",

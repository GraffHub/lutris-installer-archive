  "description": "Two years ago Granichny Island became an epicentre of a large-scale disaster of unknown origin. “The New Light” conglomerate covered up this catastrophic event - and now aims to rectify the consequences as much as they can.\r\n\r\nA massive campaign is underway, during which so-called “Volunteers” - most of whom have never held a weapon in their hands - are sent out onto Granichny. Their mission - to research the paranormal activities of the island, gathering information and undertaking dangerous tasks, all in hope of amending mistakes of the past. None of them are ready for what comes next.\r\n\r\nPlay the role of a Volunteer, and explore a place filled with threats of every shape and size - from monsters and madmen to supernatural anomalies and seemingly impossible weather patterns. Journey through the present of this forsaken world to uncover its secrets.",

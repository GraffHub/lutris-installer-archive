  "description": "In the late 22nd century, humans have commenced a construction of an orbital elevator to the Moon. A Reploid named Lumine was put in charge of the project. Lumine belonged to the new generation of Reploids, which were apparently unable to become Mavericks (i.e. turn hostile towards humans). Soon thereafter, Lumine was kidnapped by unknown assailants. The team of Maverick Hunters, composed of X, Axl, and Zero, must pursue the abductors and find what they were truly after. However, they will also have to deal with familiar enemies from the past...\r\n\r\nMega Man X8 is similar in visual style to earlier Mega Man X games, moving away from the 3D gameplay elements introduced by its predecessor. As in classic Mega Man games, the player is free to tackle the levels in any order, and must defeat a boss at the end of each. The player is able to control X, Axl, and Zero, which are distinguished by their gameplay style: X is able to equip body parts and armor, Axl specializes in guns and can also hover and glide in the air, while Zero focuses on short-range attacks.",

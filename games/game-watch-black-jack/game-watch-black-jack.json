  "description": "The game is simply Black Jack on an LCD screen. The game is very different from the standard Game & Watch games. If your cards amount to a combined number of 21, then you win the game. Black Jack is the last Game & Watch video games to be released in Japan. All games released after Black Jack were released only in other countries, despite being made in Japan.",

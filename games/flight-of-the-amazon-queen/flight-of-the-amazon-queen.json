  "description": "Flight of the Amazon Queen is an irreverent pastiche of the adventure serials that were popular in the 1940's. It is brimming with fun-filled action and a progressively difficult level of play. The game has over 100 different graphic locations with over 40 characters with which to interact. The story progresses through the use of full screen cutaway sequences giving the game dramatic depth. The CD-ROM version features full in-game speech using a variety of actors and atmospheric sound effects.",

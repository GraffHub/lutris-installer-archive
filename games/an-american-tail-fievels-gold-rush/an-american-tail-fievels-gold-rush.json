  "description": "An American Tail: Fievel's Gold Rush is a side scrolling Jump'n Run featuring Fievel, the little mouse from the movie An American Tail. It features six graphically different worlds with four levels each. Each world is completed by defeating a boss monster.\r\n\r\nWhile the background story asks for finding six pieces of the lost map to a goldmine (hence the six worlds), the basic task is to collect gold for points and extra lives. The gold also works as an indicator to see how much of a level has actually been explored. Fievel can jump on enemies and throw his hat in a boomerang fashion.",

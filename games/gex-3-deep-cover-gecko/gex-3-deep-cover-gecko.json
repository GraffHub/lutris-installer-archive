  "description": "Hamming it up like no other lizard can, Gex returns to the silver screen where he's most at home in this his third action-packed adventure on PlayStation. The Media Dimension is once more the place where disguise, intrigue and a keen sense of spoof are just some of the skills needed to get through the working day and Gex will need them all in large doses on this mission.\r\n\r\nGex's arch enemy Rez has kidnapped Agent Xtra, the beautiful Baywatch babe Marliece Andrada lookalike. With Xtra now held captive in the Media Dimension, the place where sarcasm is appreciated (er, like really a lot), Gex's mission (which he's chosen to accept) is to:\r\n1. do as many wisecracks as possible\r\n2. rescue the girl\r\nAnd as if that wasn't enough, Gex (voiced by Red Dwarf's Danny John-Jules) is hell-bent on doing it in style. . . or rather styles.\r\n\r\nGex, master of disguise and international lizard of mystery uses his new-found skills including scuba diving, gliding and snowboarding to battle the evils of Rez over a huge variety of 3D levels. The green gecko performs out of his skin as Private Gex, Cowboy Clint Gexwood, Long John Gex, Sherlock Gex and a host of other spurious persona. There is also all-new vehicle-based gameplay in which Gex controls army tanks, crocodiles, kangaroos, camels and other strange forms of transport.\r\n\r\nGex: Deep Cover Gecko - it's not serious but don't call it Shirley.",

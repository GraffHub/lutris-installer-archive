  "description": "Your planet is doomed, and there is only one remaining seat on the spaceship leading citizens to safety. This will go to the winner of a sequences of races held within this futuristic world.\r\n\r\nViewed from above and behind the car, the game boasted a lot of technologically advanced features. It was the first game to use MMX technology, and the first to support 3D acceleration straight from the box. Computer AI adjusts to your style of driving whilst in progress. It also has a range of multiplayer options including networks and split-screen, and an online internet server to automatically match player.",

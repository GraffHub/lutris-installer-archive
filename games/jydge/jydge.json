Create your own play-style by augmenting your JYDGE, modifying your Gavel rifle, and choosing fearless companions to suit the tasks at hand. Go solo or team up with Co-JYDGE in shared screen local co-op.\r\n\r\nWill you be stealthy and lurk in shadows? Or will you assault the evildoers head on? Maybe you'll brutally rocket them to bits from a distance? Or perhaps bring your own squad of reckless companions to solve the scenarios?",

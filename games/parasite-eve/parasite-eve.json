  "description": "A police drama delves into the supernatural when a monstrous force threatens the world at the sub-cellular level. Based on the Japanese science fiction novel by Hideaki Sena, Parasite Eve features a science-fiction/horror story line told through incredible 3D computer graphic visuals; detailed film-quality story sequences blend seamlessly with the realistic gameplay environments. The motion-picture-style effects complement the intricate storyline based on a best-selling Japanese sci-fi novel. \r\n\r\nThe gamer assumes the role of Aya Brea, a young female cop on the NYPD faced with the task of defeating Eve, an evil entity representing the will of the mitochondria. (Mitochondria are micro-organisms with unique DNA that live and work symbiotically inside of human cells.) The game takes place entirely in New York City, with many backgrounds based on actual locations in the Big Apple. There, Aya must use her police training, weaponry, and latent \"mitochondrial energy\" to prevent Eve from destroying the human race. Like Final Fantasy VII, PE portrays Aya and other characters as 3D polygonal characters against beautiful static backgrounds. With PE, Square has opted to use more realistically proportioned characters than those found in FFVII, and the game's two CDs are packed with copious amounts of gorgeous full-motion video to advance the story.",

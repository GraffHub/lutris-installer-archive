  "description": "2000:1: A Space Felony is a murder mystery courtroom drama set aboard the USS Endowment, an interplanetary Spacecraft that lost communication with Earth.\r\n\r\nUtilizing your camera and demonstrating your keen detective skills, you must document your findings, and piece together the crew's final hours from the aftermath. This photographic evidence is then applied in a cross-examination of the crime's prime suspect; MAL, the ship's on-board AI system. If MAL is found to be guilty, it is your responsibility to deactivate him.",

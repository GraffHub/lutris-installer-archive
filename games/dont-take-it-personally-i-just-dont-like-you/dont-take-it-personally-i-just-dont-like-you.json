  "description": "You're a college freshman with college freshman problems: you've got an awful professor, your roommate's kind of a flake, and this week really just hasn't been going your way.  Luckily, you've got just the thing planned for this weekend: a night in the woods with the girl you've been (sorta?) seeing and your new (sorta?) friends.  But things are never that easy.  As you receive strange phone calls and hear concerning noises from beyond the treeline, tensions arise in your small camp, and choices must be made that will determine your fate... or, at least, the fate of your relationships with your friends.\r\n\r\nDon't Take it Personally, I Just Don't Like You is a lo-fi relationship dramedy about camping illegally on government property in the chill of early autumn, having public anxiety attacks in crowded shopping malls, the people we choose to be with, and what we do when they don't choose us back.  In this demo, you'll be introduced to several characters and locations from the full game (including two romanceable characters!) in a fully self-contained, hour-long story.",

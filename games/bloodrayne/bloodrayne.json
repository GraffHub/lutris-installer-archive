  "description": "In the years between the World Wars, Agent BloodRayne works as a killing machine for The Brimstone Society--a top secret fraternity that hunts down and destroys supernatural threats. Two missions, five years apart, turn out to be connected by one man. For years, this man has been searching the world for powerful occult relics to bring Germany into a new age of domination. Rayne must face his elite Nazi army and prevent them from releasing horrific creatures in their quest for the artifacts. Starring the super-sexy, super-lethal, supernatural heroine BloodRayne, this original action horror game unleashed the red headed dhampir on the world.",

  "description": "On the surface, it is a timed survival game where players must keep their character fed, watered and sane until rescue by the military shortly after the infection of the city by the transformation nanites. There are an array of creatures, events, NPCs and quests (both mini-quests and majour undertakings) to explore and experience. Many of the creatures of the city will attempt to infect the player (often through sexual contact) resulting in body transformations. The game has numerous 'endings' based on how the player is infected at the end of the game, whether they survived or succumbed to the infection, and which NPCs have been encountered and saved.",

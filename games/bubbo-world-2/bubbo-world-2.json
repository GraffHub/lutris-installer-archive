  "description": "Bubbo World 2 isn't the most impressive graphical game we've seen on the MSX, far from it, but it is lovely to play and really puts you on your toes. You are constantly on edge focusing on both the golden items to be collected and all those fast paced balls moving about the screen. Thankfully a quick blast from your weapon will deal with them to the point of explosion. Just don't get trapped and get a ladder up as fast as possible!\r\n\r\nCan be downloaded freely from: http://ni.x0.com/msx/bubbo_w_2.html",

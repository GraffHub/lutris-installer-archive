  "description": "Guide your gold car through a mine, switching rails with a single button. You can only go down, but thanks to an optic illusion in the levels, you can always reach every point. Play this game alone or invite some friends and play against each other. The game supports up to 6 people on one keyboard. Everyone can enjoy this family friendly game, regardless of age or experience.\r\n\r\nPlay over 200 levels with different missions and powerups. The missions include picking up coins, bring diamonds to tunnels, racing to flags, etc. By colliding into another car, you can steal diamonds and other valuables, or pass the dynamite before it explodes. Various pickups modify your behaviour: a balloon makes you go up but not down, a ghost allows you to move through everything, ... . But whatever you do, avoid the dynamite!!!",

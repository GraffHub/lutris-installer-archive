  "description": "From the island of darkness, a siren calls... A group of strangers are approaching the mysterious Japanese island of Yamijima when a blood red tsunami pitches their boat into the waves. Those that survive the storm may soon wish they hadn't... 29 years ago, the inhabitants of Yamijima vanished during a blackout, leaving the island of darkness guarded by creatures from the Netherworld. Each survivor is unwittingly entwined in the island's grusome past, and must now defend themselves with any weapon they can find. To stay alive, they must also learn to Sightjack, a unique ability to see through the eyes of others, including the enemy; thus foreseeing the unspeakable horrors that lie in store for them.",

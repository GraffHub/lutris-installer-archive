  "description": "Memoranda is a game about forgetting and being forgotten!\r\n\r\nA point and click adventure game with magic realism elements that tells the story of a young lady who gradually realizes she is forgetting her own name.

Including a World War II surviving soldier to an elephant taking shelter in a man’s cottage hoping to become a human.

  "description": "Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chose is a remake of the NES game and the PlayStation version and tells the same story with an added chapter.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is the standard RPG: exploring lands and dungeons with a party, encountering enemies and battling them with weapons and magic to gain experience points to level up their character. The game is divided in six chapters, the first four tells of the hero (or heroine) and lets the player partake in quest with a party of characters while the fifth one has the player take control of the hero/heroine. The sixth chapter is a new feature and was not in the original game that has the player take control of the hero and his friends on a quest for revenge.\r\n\r\nThe player utilizes the stylus pen to pick commands in the battle interface menu and uses the D-pad to move around on the map. In addition to the classic features, new ones were added as well such as a Casino minigame and the ability to set up their characters strategies in the final chapter (which are non-playable). The map has also been tweaked a bit and players can save their game in the House of Healing instead of visiting the king.",

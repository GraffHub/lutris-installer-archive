  "description": "Metroids. The most dangerous species in the galaxy.\r\nOne of the most important moments of the Metroid storyline happened in SR388, after a titanic battle between Samus and the mighty Queen Metroid. Memories of that event start to fade... it was long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you can experience Metroid 2: Return of Samus again. With improved graphics, gameplay, and new areas. Join Samus in her most dangerous adventure within the depths of planet SR388, all the Metroid evolutions are waiting for you...\r\n\r\nProject AM2R aims to recreate Metroid 2 with updated graphics and gameplay. Taking elements from newer Metroid titles: the fast paced gameplay of Metroid: Zero Mission, the atmosphere and solitude of Super Metroid, and adding new game mechanics, AM2R is one of the most ambitious Metroid fan games.",

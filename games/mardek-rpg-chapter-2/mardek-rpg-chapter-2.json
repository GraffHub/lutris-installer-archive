  "description": "MARDEK is an epic Flash RPG in the style of NES and SNES RPGs, like the early Final Fantasy games. It is highly story-driven, featuring a setting that merges swords-and-sorcery Fantasy with sci-fi. It will be eight chapters long.\r\n\r\nThis is the second chapter. Eight years have passed since the events of chapter 1, and Mardek and Deugan have joined the Royal Guard of Goznor!",

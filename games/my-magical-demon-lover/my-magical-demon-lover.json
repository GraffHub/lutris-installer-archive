He's the great grandson of the wizard who protects his village and the first one to show any affinity for magic in three generations.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting fiveever for his great grandfather to take him as his apprentice it's finally happened! He's been summoned up to the tower where his great grandfather watches over the village. But it's not what he expects...\r\n\r\nPercival has no intention of mentoring him. He's eager to leave for a smutty vacation from his village-protecting duties. Tristan needs to take over, and that means picking a mentor from three demons Percival lined up for him.\r\n\r\nThe demons will give Tristan the magic he needs to become a wizard, but for a price! ...His butt.\r\n\r\nFortunately these demons love humans and really want to connect with one. Tristan has a chance to fall in love with one of three demons, but which one will he chose?",

  "description": "Welcome to Gregory House, a ghoulish hotel run by a sinister old rat by the name of, you guessed it, Gregory, and occupied by a host of freakish 'guests'. You're a wandering spirit who's accidentally entered this chaotic house of horrors and, unless you can retrieve the twelve lost souls that the residents have pilfered between them and return them to Death, you'll be trapped there for eternity.\r\n\r\nIt's not going to be easy; each occupant is quite fond of their captured spirit and won't want to give it up without a fight, although if you successfully outsmart them, that's exactly what'll happen. Employ your stealth and spying skills to keep track of each guest's actions and learn their weaknesses, then exploit this knowledge to snatch the soul. They won't be happy once you've grabbed them, however, so be sure to avoid running into anyone you've deceived lest they turn you into the star of a grisly Horror Show...",

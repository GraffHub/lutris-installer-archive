  "description": "It's pre-hysterical! Millionaire playboy caveman Millstone Rockafella arranges a wild nÂ’ wacky BC bike race, the winner of which receives the ultimate boulderdash bike. Cool n' crazy Cliff Ace has had his sunglasses set on a boulderdash bike since he was knee-high, so he signs up for the race - taking his cave-babe Roxy along for the ride! The 32X pushes graphics to the limit with 256 colors for in-game graphics and full 24-bit for static display. The stone-age never looked better!",

Starting with nothing more than a small base of local support, you must build a nationwide faction powerful enough to start a revolution, and oust the president... by any means necessary.\r\n\r\n- Rise to power through the use of military force, crime, business, politics or religion\r\n- Manipulate the masses or silence the opposition\r\n- Explore living and breathing cities populated by thousands of citizens\r\n- Lead by compassion or ruthless aggression, the choice is yours\r\n- Thousands of variables allow for a new and different experience every time you play",

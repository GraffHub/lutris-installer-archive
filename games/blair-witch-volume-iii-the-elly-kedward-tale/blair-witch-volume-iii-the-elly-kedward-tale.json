  "description": "Blair Witch Volume III: The Elly Kedward Tale is the final thriller in the mind-shattering, three-part mystery that explores the heart of the Blair Witch Myth. The legend originates in 1785, when Elly Kedward is accused of witchcraft and is forever banished from the Blair Township. She withdraws into the silence of the woods and is forgotten until the chilling disappearance of the children begins.\r\n\r\nJonathon Prye, once a pastor, but now in conflict with his own shattered faith, takes on the role of the fanatic witch hunter. He journeys to the hysteria-seized town of Blair where he must master all forms of magic - white and black - if he is to save anyone, including himself.",

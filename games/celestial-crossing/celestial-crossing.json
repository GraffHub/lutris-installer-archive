  "description": "The characters we create in games are fascinating. They are often a projection of our power fantasies.\r\nIf you consider yourself weak, you often create a strong character. If you think you are dumb, you will create a wise and intelligent character.\r\nThey represent traits that we don't have, but wish we had.\r\nOften they are our polar opposite. Good people get to be bad, and shy people get to be courageous.\r\n\r\nSo what would happen if you came face to face with your in-game alter ego?\r\nDo you think you would get along? Would you like each other? Or would you not stand the sight of each other?",

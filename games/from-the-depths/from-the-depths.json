The game is currently in alpha and contains a wide range of single player content including:\r\n\r\n    A creative mode allowing you to push your designs to the limit and ensure the total annihilation of your opponents.\r\n    A campaign waged over hundreds of islands against eight unique factions.\r\n    A Story Mode where you can (eventually!) play 15 missions as each of the eight factions - a fantastic mixture of strategy, design and wild battles! Defend your fleet against waves of enemy forces in a series of extremely tough challenges that unlock new components.",

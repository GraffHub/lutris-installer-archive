Fly through the different landscapes battle others while in search of powerups such as invisibility or extra ammo. Maps are big enough to include hidden spots and even some \"camping\" areas. A \"career mode\" allows you to increase your reputation and fight tougher opponents while obtaining better weapons and mounts.",

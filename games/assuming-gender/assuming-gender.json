Every college has slammed\r\ntheir door in your face and it looks like this may be the end for your\r\neducation until you're enlightened by some news.... literally. The\r\nGender-fluid movement. Can you use this new movement to your advantage? This is a game that does not shy away from controversy. It is a parody of our current social construct with sexism, bigotry and other negative aspects found within the real world included. It may cause offense at the start but this is for the sake of the plot in the same manner as a movie or book.",

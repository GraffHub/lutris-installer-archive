  "description": "A female blue jay, named Flicky, must collect her chicks and lead them safely back to their nest, while they are chased by two cats. The cats make her chicks wandering off and try to eat her! Each level offers about a dozen objects like watering cans, hammers, and cups, to throw at and knock out the cats. The next level starts when all chicks are returned home safely.",

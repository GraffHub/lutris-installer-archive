  "description": "Gunz is a free Internet multiplayer shooter with some RPG elements. Shooter gameplay is standard online shooter fare; there's a Deathmatch game which is a free-for-all melee where the first player to hit a preset number of kills wins the match, Team Deathmatch where you score points for your team by killing members of another team, and so on. To add some variety, players can perform tricks such as shoot-dodging, wall kick-flipping, melee weapon combos, and others.\r\n\r\nThe real distinctiveness of Gunz is the RPG elements. You start the game with old and rusty weapons and gear. Every kill you score gives you experience points and cash. When you get enough experience points, you level up, which allows you to use better weapons, armor, and equipment, and the cash you win can be used to buy it.",

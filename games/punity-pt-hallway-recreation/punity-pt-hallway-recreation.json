  "description": "I started this project for a 3D modelling workshop I'm teaching for a game developer group here in Calgary. At first I just wanted to make the PT hallway, then started adding sounds and...other things out of obsession. In total I've spent about 104 hours over 4 weeks making this, and I'm happy / burnt out enough to stop here. I modelled, textured, animated, and scripted everything. I've been using both Unity and Blender for 3 years now as part of my aspiration of becoming a game developer, so it's turned me into a jack-of-all-trades of sorts.",

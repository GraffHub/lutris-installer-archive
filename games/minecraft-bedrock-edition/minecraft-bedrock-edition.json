The game runs on the new Bedrock engine and has many new features, including cross-platform play between all platforms using the Bedrock Edition. It also features rentable Realms, new achievements and trophies, cloud saves, and more.\r\n\r\nWith the release of this Bedrock Edition, all versions except the Apple TV Edition and PlayStation Editions are not supported anymore, as in, only the Bedrock Edition will receive future content updates. Sony has declined the Better Together update and the Apple TV Edition hasn't received it yet, so those Legacy console editions will keep receiving updates.\r\n\r\nOwners of digital copies, or players who played the disc version for more than 5 hours, of the Xbox One Edition and Nintendo Switch Edition got this version as a free upgrade, others will need to buy this version separately.\r\n\r\nThe original Minecraft PC version got renamed to Minecraft: Java Edition.",

The game itself can be updated from the launcher .\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: YOU NEED A COPY OF THE GAME BOUGHT ON GOOGLE PLAY FOR IT TO WORK and you have to log into the launcher using your google account. If you don't own the game you will only have access to the trial mode.\r\n\r\nFor now you have to set up the game version manually editing your profile if the launcher is stuck at \"Please wait\"",

  "description": "ArmA: Armed Assault is a direct descendant of Operation Flashpoint, but the name is no longer used as Codemasters holds the IP.\r\n\r\nThis military shooter with a focus on realism takes place on the fictional Atlantic island of Sahrani, divided by a communist regime in the north and a democratic monarchy in the south. When US forces leave the south after a training, the northern dictator decides to attack the south. The player takes control of one soldier of a squad who has not left the island yet, to assist the local militia.\r\n\r\nThe campaign measures up to 400 square kilometers, 4 times as large as in its predecessor, using the Real Virtuality 2 engine. Unlike Operation Flashpoint, players may now jump into other units than one designated character during missions. The main campaign offers over 20 missions with non-linear options. The game AI can also act independently from the player's actions.\r\n\r\nThe focus on realism is reflected in the weapon and vehicle models, weapon ballistics, sighting, damage, recoil and reloading. There are destructible objects and terrain, and animals, even birds and insects, react to movement and action on the terrain. The player cannot jump, but swimming has been introduced.\r\n\r\nMultiplayer allows as many players to join as the server supports, and AI NPCs, both as allies and foes, can also be added. There is also a cooperative mode for the singleplayer missions, and with the included editor, complex battle scenarios can be scripted.",

  "description": "In Exile, you were cast into the underworld by the Empire. In Exile II, you claimed the pit as your own and fought off the Empire. In Exile III, you battled to return home, to return to the surface and the sunlight you thought you had lost forever. Now, with Blades of Exile, the adventures continue. On the surface, rebellion is brewing. In Exile, a new war is tearing the subterranean nation apart. There's plenty of war and strife, and plenty of chances for a band of adventurers to make their fortunes!",

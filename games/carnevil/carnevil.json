  "description": "CarnEvil is an arcade game that is played with a light gun. In this horror-themed rail shooter, you play a nameless protagonist who leaves a spooky cemetery tour to investigate an urban legend involving one of the tombstones. The legend of the evil professor Ludwig von Tökkentäkker's undead carnival is revealed to be true when the protagonist places a golden token into the stone jester head on top of the professor's tombstone. This causes the head to come to life and raise CarnEvil from the ground, leaving the protagonist to face off against it's monsters and defeat Tökkentäkker.",

  "description": "OGame is a strategy game set in space, with thousands of players from across the world competing at the same time. You only need a regular web browser to play.\r\n\r\n\r\n    You start out with just one undeveloped world and turn that into a mighty empire able to defend your hard earned colonies.\r\n    Create an economic and military infrastructure to support your quest for the next greatest technological achievements.\r\n    Wage war against other empires as you struggle with other players to gain the materials.\r\n    Negotiate with other emperors and create an alliance or trade for much needed resources.\r\n    Build an armada to enforce your will throughout the universe.\r\n    Hoard your resources behind an impregnable wall of planetary defences.\r\n    Whatever you wish to do, OGame can let you do it.\r\n    Will you terrorize the area around you? Or will you strike fear into the hearts of those who attack the helpless?",

  "description": "Manhattan Chase will let you choose between Angel, a brave and proud member of the NYPD, and Yasmin, a cold-hearted and sadistic criminal. Reveal the exciting story about these two completely different girls by finishing all episodes from both sides of the law!\r\n\r\nAs if these action-packed story-episodes are not enough to guarantee a long lifetime of this game, there is also a multi-play mode. Team6 did their best to make this their most challenging game ever: The car-chases are more intense, agressive and addictive then showed in any other game ever before, and the 3rd person action makes sure there is plenty of variation in gameplay terms.\r\n\r\nIn 3rd person the girls carry effective but 'ordinary' weapons such as a machinegun, grenadelauncher or sniper: But once inside one of the dozen available cars the mass-destruction weapons become available! Vulcan-cannons, Multi-missiles, homing rockets, mines and even airstrikes are yours to use or abuse.",

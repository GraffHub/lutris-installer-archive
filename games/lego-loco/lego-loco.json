  "description": "In Lego Loco, you build and design a town with lego buildings, and then build railroads to transport the people. You can also build roads so people can use their cars. You get to choose where everything goes and you can also pick people up and move them around. Another feature is the ability to send postcards over the Internet to other players. You can play on your own or play multiplayer.",

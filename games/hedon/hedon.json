  "description": "Hedon is an entirely original game designed throughout a fair number of years, first as a concept/fantasy world, and thanks to the Doom modding community - an actual thing in the works.\r\n\r\nWhy give Hedon a try?\r\n\r\n➣ It's an old-school/boomercore shooter, not by just looks and engine, but by gameplay.\r\n➣ Gory, fast paced shooting, a solid arsenal of weapons and magic items.\r\n➣ Sprawling levels that offer a degree of freedom and don't hold the player's hand. Exploring, hunting secrets, backtracking, patience and having to figure out what to do next is key. Monsters and pickups are hand-placed and vary according to the difficulty you play on.\r\n➣  Original story packed with lots of lore and doubled by a permeating atmosphere.\r\n➣ Original soundtrack ranging from tense to serene ambient, spiced up with bursts of metal. Also, did I mention Alexander Brandon? If you enjoyed the Unreal and Deus Ex soundtracks, you're in for a treat!\r\n➣ Thousands of hours of work put into an original concept, digital drawn graphics (textures, sprites, frame by frame animations etc.), scripting, sound effects and level design, all by a one man dev team aiming to create a unique game with a unique atmosphere.",

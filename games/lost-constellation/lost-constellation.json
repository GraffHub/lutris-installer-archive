  "description": "Lost Constellation is a Longest Night ghost story. Travel into the frozen woods in a folktale from the world of Night In The Woods.\r\n\r\nIt was made by Alec Holowka, Scott Benson, and Bethany Hockenberry in the last weeks of 2014.\r\n\r\nThis is a supplemental game, which is to say it's not a demo or a preview of Night In The Woods. In some ways Lost Constellation is a lot like NITW, but in a lot of ways it's not. It's a tangent, a side-story, a way for us to explore a bit in a more off-the-cuff manner.\r\n\r\nWe hope you love it!",

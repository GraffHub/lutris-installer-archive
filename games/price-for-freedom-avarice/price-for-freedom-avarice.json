  "description": "Price for Freedom: Avarice is a top down RPG, heavily inspired by old games such as Baldurs Gate. So expect decent amount of text, and people to talk to. It is based on the webcomic series (http://priceforfreedom.net), in the same setting and region. The game will tell the story of another cast of characters, in another town, and another time. The format will allow our team to drastically expand on world lore, side stories, and overall depth. Just as the original webcomic the game includes adult material, integrated naturally with the story and game flow. Adult material will be dedicated CG animated scenes with supportive narration. Combat will not include adult material, so no \"lose to get smut reward\" scenario.",

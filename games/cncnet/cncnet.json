  "description": "CnCNet was first born in 2009. We quickly became popular through our early versions of CnCNet (version 1-4), starting with the original Command & Conquer we eventually expanded into of Red Alert, eventually expanding to Tiberian Sun, and more recently Yuri's Revenge.\r\n\r\nAt CnCNet, we collectively share one goal, re-establishing C&C Online to the best of our ability. We also strive on the simplicity of how easy CnCNet is to use.\r\n\r\nWe make sure you can still play your childhood games today, whether it's with the latest operating system like Windows 10, or even running on Windows XP, we cover the broad spectrum of O/S. We also actively eradicate those pesky cheats for online play, be it old and new.\r\n\r\nSo that's pretty much it. Here we are rocking in 2017 and smashing records with our most recent achievement of 800+ simultaneous players online.",

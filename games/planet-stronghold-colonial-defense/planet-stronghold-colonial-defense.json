  "description": "Planet Stronghold: Colonial Defense brings you back in time in the early settlement days of the Planet Stronghold colony.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBy a bizarre coincidence, two captains, two siblings, get stuck in the same colony: Alex and Diana Nelson. Take control of one of them, and discover the mysteries and the dangers of Planet Stronghold, and the personalities of the various characters of your team.\r\n\r\nThe game features a big card-collectible gameplay part, easy to learn but hard to master. Upgradable cards brings even more replayability, especially at higher difficulty levels.\r\n\r\nFor those looking forward more to the story and visual novel/dating sim aspect, you can play the game in \"Visual Novel Mode\" and enjoy the game dialogues and the beautiful painted artwork style: there are eight characters to befriend, and if you play your cards right, romance!",

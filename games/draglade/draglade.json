  "description": "Draglade (カスタムビートバトル ドラグレイド Kasutamu Bīto Batoru Doragureido, Custom Beat Battle Draglade) is a fighting video game with music video game and role-playing game elements for the Nintendo DS developed by Dimps and published in Japan by Banpresto and Bandai Namco Games. It was then later published in the US by Atlus.\r\n\r\nThe fighting system is different from other fighting games in that there are not a lot of directional inputs needed for moves. Instead, special moves are set by collecting \"Bullets\" and then activating them with the DS's touch screen.\r\nThe story of Draglade takes place in a post-modern setting where the world's primary source of power is a form of energy called \"Matter.\" A piece of technology called a G-Con is capable of absorbing Matter and transforming it into a physical object. A weapon conjured by this means is called a Glade, which can emit a distinct sound when colliding with other objects. During the era that the events of Draglade take place, fighting using Glades is the world's most popular sport, called \"Grapping.\" The story follows four characters on their own individual quests become professional Grappers.",

  "description": "The young hero Brian is tasked with a quest to save the land of Celtland. Brian's father, Lord Bartholomy, has mysteriously disappeared. The Eletale Book has also been stolen, which preserves harmony in Celtland. Brian must find his father and bring back the Eletale Book. In his journey he will travel linearly through the land, passing through towns, dungeons, and paths filled with monsters.\r\n\r\nQuest 64's combat exists in a mixture of turn-based and real-time inputs. In combat Brian and his opponents take turns moving and selecting spells to attack each other with. With luck and diligence attacks can sometimes be avoided manually. Brian has four schools of magic he can draw from; Air, Earth, Water, and Fire, and each can be strengthened with mana points gained from leveling or found in the world. Strengthening a school of magic makes it more powerful and unlocks new spells. Brian can carry items to heal or temporarily boost his stats, but there is no equipment in the game. The North American version of the game also has no in-game currency; some villagers will offer items, and free replacements if they are used, but items found in dungeons are used once and can never be replaced.\r\n[edit description | view history]",

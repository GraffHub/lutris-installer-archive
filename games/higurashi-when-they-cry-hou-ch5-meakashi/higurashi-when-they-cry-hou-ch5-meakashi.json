  "description": "June, 1983. \r\n\r\nThe summer heat has arrived earlier than it does most years. \r\nBy day there are cicadas, and by night, the higurashi.\r\n\r\nHinamizawa, a small village in the Japanese countryside. \r\nWhile there are fewer than two thousand people there, every year, 'something' happens.\r\n\r\nFor the past 4 years, someone has died, and someone else has gone missing. \r\nThis series of deaths and disappearances is connected to the local resistance against a now-abandoned dam construction project. \r\nA murder during the construction, covered up by the local authorities, is being re-enacted year after year. \r\nIs it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse?\r\n\r\nSomeone who was supposed to be there... isn't. \r\nSomeone who wasn't supposed to be there... is.\r\n\r\nSomeone who was alive last night is now dead, and someone who is here right now isn't alive.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to avert this tragedy. There is no choice but to give up trying. \r\n\r\nBut even so... please don't give up.",

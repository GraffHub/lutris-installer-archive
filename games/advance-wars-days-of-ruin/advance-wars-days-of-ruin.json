  "description": "The second Advance Wars game for the Nintendo DS brings a more serious tone to the previously lighthearted take on war. The past Advance Wars characters are replaced with a new cast fighting for survival in a meteor-destroyed world.\r\n\r\nA turn-based strategy game, the player captures cites and factories to produce more units in an effort to destroy the enemy force or capture all their buildings. Commanding Officers (COs) that used to be omnipresent are now attached to an individual unit, providing benefits to your units in the vicinity of the CO. COs also have powers that affect the entire field that are charged up by dealing damage to enemies near the CO.",

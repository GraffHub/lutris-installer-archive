  "description": "Modular spaceship building\r\n\r\nBuild your entire ship out of pieces, LEGO style. Thruster placement and mass distribution define the dynamics of your ship, so different designs feel very different to fly. Block by block destruction encourages you to build redundant systems and protect your most vital parts. Automatic ship repair and a user friendly designer with features like copy & paste and undo allows complex designs with minimal effort.\r\nBeautiful, emergent ecosystem\r\n\r\nProcedurally generated open living world full of many different types of AI spaceships, space stations, and synthetic plants, each intent on self perpetuation. Take advantage of impromptu battles between rival factions to recover objectives, or run away after your opponent calls in reinforcements. AI ships can retreat if overwhelmed, scavenge for resources, investigate disturbances, self repair, reproduce, and generally behave as artificial lifeforms rather than target dummies.\r\nDestructive combat\r\n\r\nWield a wide variety of projectile and beam weapons, missiles, rockets and torpedoes, deployable drones, and more against your enemies. Defend yourself with shields, armor, point defense systems, and pure maneuverability. Combat is a mix of skill, tactics, and preparation â€“ an expertly piloted fighter can take down an enemy fleet, but having a well balanced arsenal helps.",

  "description": "Fifteen-year-old Lynn has never had the easiest life, but things have become even worse thanks to her upcoming GCSEs. Her parents are always arguing, her big sister is pregnant, and Lynn is terrified that, come exam time, she’ll fail everything and disappoint her entire family.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, Lynn’s been suffering from recurring bad dreams that are cryptic, unsettling, and often violent. Curiously enough, these dreams often revolve around a girl from her school called Lynne, who looks so similar to Lynn it’s almost unsettling.\r\n\r\nAs Lynn’s interest in Lynne begins to border on obsession, Lynn’s grasp on reality begins to grow more and more tenuous.\r\n\r\nWill Lynn be able to pass her exams – or will her own fears and anxieties consume her?",

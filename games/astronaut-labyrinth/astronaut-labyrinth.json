  "description": "This is an action arcade/adventure game for Spectrum 48K (without music)/128K (with AY music) made using AGDX (a modified version of Arcade Game Designer 4.7) and AGDMusicizer II.\r\n\r\nThe main character - the payer - is Brian Bentley, a space explorer who was sucked into an intergalactic portal and landed inside a sort of astronaut-shaped labyrinth when he was traveling in his spacecraft.\r\n\r\nSo Brian must collect the 6 parts of an astronaut draw to activate the way out.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the parts are scattered amongst the labyrinth.\r\n\r\nBut that is not enought.\r\nHe also has to find the power battery to make the exit works.\r\n\r\nThe battery is in an hidden place and to access that Brian has to find the teleport key first.\r\n\r\nAfter that, Brian can finally escape from the Astronaut Labyrinth.",

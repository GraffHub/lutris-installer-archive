It is an inofficial sequel of the other two Broken Sword games from Revolution Software.\r\n\r\n\"The last months were quite a blow of fate to George Stobbart. First he had to leave Nico for one year because of an important trip to the USA, then his beloved grandfather died of a cancerous growth. But that was not everything. When George receives a telegram from France one day he already has a foreboding of evil. The consigner is–Nicole Collard, Paris, France. His presentiment shall turn into cruel certainty: Nico is dead! \"First my grandpa and now Nico?\", George thinks and takes the first plane to Paris.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival: Rain, storm, like an appropriate divine answer to George's situation. In Nico's apartment the next shock: Nico is alive. Totally bewildered he tells her about the telegram but Nico seems not to be surprised. On the contrary, she asks George to leave the apartment. She does not seem to take delight in the unexpected reunion.\r\n\r\nStill sorting his thoughts in the Cafe della Chandelle Verte–where everything began–George hears an alarming story about Nico from Andre Lobineau making the unpleasant thought germinate in him that the Neo-Templars could still exist…\"",

  "description": "Pro Cycling Manager: Season 2008 is the sequel to Pro Cycling Manager: Season 2007 and part of the Cycling Manager series game group. Like its predecessors you take on the role of the manager of a cycling team and you have to push them to the top. Like the 2006 and 2007 iterations of the game it has an official license and thus comes with real bikers and the Official Tour de France cycling event (of the year 2008). The game comes with 65 officially licensed teams to manage.\r\n\r\nAs manager of a team you can influence the strategy of the team and individual players, shop for equipment, train your riders, and manage contracts. In the career mode you need to put the right riders in the team at the right tours. Each of the 180 stages is presented in full real time 3D and you can make adjustments to your racers strategies on the fly.",

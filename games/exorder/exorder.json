  "description": "The fantasy world of Exorder awaits you!\r\n\r\nExorderâ€™s got looks and smarts! Under the layer of colorful graphics lies a cleverly designed tactics system. The game is a solid entry into the turn-based tactics genre that focus on fun and easy to pick up combat.\r\n\r\nSingle-player campaign consists of 12 missions linked by a fantasy-style story about three neighbouring countries and a game of the throne after the deceased king. This mode gets you acquainted with skills needed to successfully command a roster of Exorder's quirky units.\r\n\r\nIn Multiplayer Mode you can choose between online matchmaking and casual skirmish. Fight against randomly selected players of a similar skill level. Defeat your enemy to climb up global leaderboard! Or casually create a custom multiplayer game for up to 4 players, either offline or online.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of Exorder is to provide a solid entry in the underrepresented genre of turn-based tactics games that focus on fun and easy to pick up combat. The game is being developed with a team of three (the entirety of Solid9 Studio) and we do our best to provide you - the player - with the best gaming experience possible.",

  "description": "This top down billiard game has a solo play mode and a VS mode in which each player takes turns. There are two modes to play: Pocket, and 9 ball. Each mode requires you to earn a certain score in order to win. While you play there is a woman who cheers you on. Once you win the match with the predetermined score, the game starts Show Time. During this event, the woman who is cheering you on is undressed to her underwear as a reward.",

  "description": "Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain.\r\n\r\nTo quote Jazzuo himself: \"The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well\".",

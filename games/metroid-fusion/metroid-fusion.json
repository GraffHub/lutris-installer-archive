  "description": "While lending mission support on planet SR388, interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is attacked by an X parasite, an organism with the ability to mimic the abilities of any creature it infects. Near death, Samus is saved by a vaccine made from the DNA of the last Metroidâ€”the X parasite's only natural predator. When the X spread to a research station in orbit around SR388, a weakened Samus is forced to exterminate them all... or die trying.\r\n\r\n* Search out the X! Experience the classic Metroid game play as Samus explores the secret passages of a massive research station teeming with hostile life forms.\r\n\r\n* Live and learn! Samus must master new moves: clinging to ledges, leaping to high ladders, and firing new weapons like Diffusion Missiles. Along the way, collect classic power-ups like the Morph Ball, Screw Attack and Wave Beam.\r\n\r\n* There's nowhere to hide! The SA-X, an unstoppable X mimicking Samus, is on the loose, and it could be just around the corner...",

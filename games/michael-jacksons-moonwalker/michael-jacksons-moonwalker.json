  "name": "Michael Jackson's Moonwalker",
  "slug": "michael-jacksons-moonwalker",
  "year": 1990,
  "description": "The gameplay is focused on finding children, all of whom resemble Katie from the movie, which are scattered throughout the level, some behind objects such as doors. Most of the objects are empty or contain enemies. Jackson's standard attack is a stylized high kick that is commonly incorporated into his dance routines. If the player continues to hold the kick button, and moves Jackson backwards, he performs his Moonwalk dance move. Jackson has a combined health/ability bar. He can spin, being invulnerable in the process. However, this spin move slowly drains health. If the spin is held for more than two seconds, Jackson throws his hat in boomerang fashion, which will destroy most enemies. The longer the spin move is held, the wider distance that the fedora will cover. If held down long enough, a dance magic scene similar to the arcade version plays, featuring dance moves taken from the film clips of whatever song is playing in the background. Michael can also use the magic to slide down banisters and eliminate multiple enemies in the process. In certain levels, a shooting star may appear which temporarily transforms Michael into a cyborg that can attack enemies with various artillery, but cannot collect children. Almost every stage has three levels. The final level of the Mega Drive/Genesis version is a first person \"flight sim\" type battle between Jackson (now transformed into a space ship) and Mr. Big's ship.",

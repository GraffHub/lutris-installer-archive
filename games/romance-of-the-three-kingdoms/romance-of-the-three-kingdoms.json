Each claims to be emperor, however none is powerful enough to retain the title. Romance of the Three Kingdoms puts you in the role of one of the warlords of Second Century China. As a master, you must recruit the best generals in the country and win their loyalty. They will advise you in times of peace, and fight alongside you on the battlefield.

  "description": "Mario Bros. is a Multi Screen Game & Watch video game that stars Mario and Luigi. It marks the debut of Luigi. The Multi Screen unit is held sideways in a similar fashion to reading a book. The game was released in 1983 by Nintendo, and while it has the same name as Mario Bros. in the arcades, the game is not based off of it, actually coming before the arcade version.",

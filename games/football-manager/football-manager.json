  "description": "Football Manager is a video game series published and developed by Addictive Games, the label set up by the game's creator Kevin Toms. The first game was released in 1982.[1] It was then ported to most home computers during the 1980s and spawned several sequels: Football Manager 2[2] (1988) and Football Manager World Cup Edition[3] (1990), both designed by Kevin Toms, and finally Football Manager 3[4] (1992), without Toms' involvement. Football Manager 3 sold poorly, and as a result the series came to an end. The series was claimed to have sold over a million copies by 1992.[5] The game was to start a whole new genre of computer game, the football management simulation.\r\n\r\nIN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Manager_(1982_series)",

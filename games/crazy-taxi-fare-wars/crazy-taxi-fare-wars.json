  "description": "Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars brings the chaotically fun action of Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2 together for the PSP system. In an all-out bumper-grinding brawl you must race other cabbies, dashing, ramming and smashing your way to that high paying fare.\r\n\r\nWith a boot load of mini-games, 32 in all, Fare Wars is designed for gaming on the go. These mini-games let you practice and improve your fare snatching skills, and get to grips with new gameplay elements like ramming your opponent's vehicle to steal their passengers and slowing down the time they have to deliver their fares.",

  "description": "Allegiance is an online multiplayer game (the only offline component is the tutorial) with action and strategy elements. The game features six playing modes: Deathmatch, deathmatch with a time restriction capture the flag, properity (generating a certain income), artifacts (searching for artifacts) and conquest (conquering all systems). Every player can take control over the various space ships with different tactical uses, e.g. salvation ships for rescuing shot down pilots (otherwise they are out for a while) or stealth fighters for scouting. Then the game plays like a traditional space simulation.",

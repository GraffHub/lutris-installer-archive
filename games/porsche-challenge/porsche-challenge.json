  "description": "Porsche Challenge is a racing game exclusively dedicated to Porsche's awesome new roadster called Boxster.\r\n\r\nThe game was developed in collaboration with Porsche. As a result of this collaboration the game features only Porsche Boxsters as cars and focuses more on realistic look and feel of these Boxsters than on fast and furious action and spectacular crashes.\r\n\r\nThe game features interactive tracks, driver personalities, and a range of different game modes, including multiplayer. There are 4 different tracks available: USA, Japan, Alpine, and Stuttgart. Each track can be played in 3 different modes: classic, long mode (which features extra shortcuts and extensions to the tracks) and interactive mode (which remixes and extends the tracks). The action can be viewed by three different camera angles.",

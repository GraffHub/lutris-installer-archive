  "description": "It is about ten years after King Arthur's death. The forces held so long at bay by the legendary king are now pressing on the borders of Albion, the home of the Britons.\r\n\r\nCamelot is still a thriving and vibrant capital, but it is starting to show signs of decay. The border zones of Albion are being threatened by the barbarous Norse, who live in the far north icy wastelands of Midgard, and by the magical Celts, who live on the western island of Hibernia.The Norse and Celts, long held back by the strong Briton kingdom, are sensing that their time is finally nigh - perhaps this is the time to press home their dream of expanding into, and finally crushing, Arthur's hated Realm.",

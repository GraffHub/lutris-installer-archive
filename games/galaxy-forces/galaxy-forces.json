  "description": "A single and multiplayer 2D space shooter game. Each player is in control of a ship. The goal is to kill everything to get the best score (dogfight), or race against the clock and your opponents to get the fastest time (race). There is also a mode where the players compete to transport cargo (mission), and where they cooperate (mission_coop).\r\n\r\nThere are more than 50 official levels, and a map-editor is included so you can create your own. Also online Hiscores are available.\r\n\r\nThe game is inspired by Gravity Force on the Amiga, and it could be considered a Gravity Force clone with more features.",

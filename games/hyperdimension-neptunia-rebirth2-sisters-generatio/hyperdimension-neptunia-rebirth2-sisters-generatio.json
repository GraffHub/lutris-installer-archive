Have up to 4 characters on the battlefield, and 4 more on the sidelines, ready to jump in and give their support!\r\nStella goes Rogue! Send Stella out to brave Gamindustri’s dungeons in this real-time mini-game and she’ll collect all kinds of treasure for you – you just sit back and eat pudding! Be careful though, because if she dies in the dungeon, she’ll lose all her special gear!\r\nThe World’s your Oyster! Customize the Gamindustri experience with Plans, which allow you to do things like increase/decrease enemy difficulty, change the items you’ll receive from a dungeon, and more!\r\nBuild-a-Sword! Use Idea Chips and Blank Discs to create custom equipment that can open up new worlds of skills for you!",

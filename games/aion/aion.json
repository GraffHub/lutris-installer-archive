  "description": "Aion is a massive multiplayer online role-playing game which takes place in the world of Atreia, a land divided by the Epic Cataclysm into two halves with a deep Abyss in between. Asmodae occupies the top half and is home to the Asmodians. The Elyos people live in the lower half, known as Elysea. Both races have three things in common: 1) They have wings and the ability to fly; 2) They have each vowed to destroy the other; and 3) They both fear and abhor The Balaur.\r\n\r\nLegends tell us that the god Aion created the Balaur to rule and care for the people of Atreia. In time, the Balaur became obsessed with power and domination, so Aion created twelve Empyrean Lords to safeguard the planet. During the long war between the Empyrean Lords and the Balaur, the Epic Cataclysm occurred and caused the Tower of Eternity to fall into The Abyss and the Balaur with it. Now the Balaur have escaped their prison and are threatening the populace again.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing which race you wish to play, pick from 4 Classes to begin your adventure: Warrior, Scout, Mage or Priest. During the character creation process, you will name your character and refine his or her appearance. You can create up to 8 different characters.\r\n\r\nYour primary goal at first is to advance through the levels, taking on many quests and learning the way of the world by exploring. You will be able to fly at Level 10 when you receive your wings after going through an Ascension. At level 25 you will be given tests to prove your readiness to enter The Abyss itself. Level 25 is also when PvP play becomes available to you.",

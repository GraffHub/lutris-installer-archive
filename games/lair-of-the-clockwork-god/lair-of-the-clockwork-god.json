  "description": "WHY PLAY ONLY ONE GENRE OF GAME when you could be playing two slightly different ones at the exact same time?\r\n\r\nBEN is a die-hard, old-school LucasArts Adventure fan.\r\nHe has one foot stuck in the 90s, his feet never leave the floor, and heâ€™s happiest collecting any old junk he can lay his hands on, in the hopes of combining it all together to solve a satisfying puzzle.\r\n\r\nHis cohort and sidekick DAN\r\n...has aspirations to be the next big hit indie platform character. He's got everything he needs: he's hip, he's sensitive, and his nose is a different colour to the rest of his face.\r\n\r\nLAIR OF THE CLOCKWORK GOD sees you switching between both characters and using their unique abilities together in a race-against-time effort to stop all the Apocalypses happening simultaneously, by teaching an old computer about feelings.\r\n\r\nSolve classic point-and-click style puzzles as Ben to create unique upgrade items for Dan, so he can jump higher, run faster and blast away at everything with a shiny new gun. Then, run and jump as Dan to unlock new areas and exciting new puzzles for Ben!",

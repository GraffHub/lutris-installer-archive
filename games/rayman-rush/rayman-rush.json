  "description": "Rayman - armless, legless, utterly lacking in knees and elbows. Not the most likely candidate for a racing game, you might think, but you'd be wrong. Our limbless hero, never afraid of a challenge, has wound up in a game where he's got to sprint for victory, racing 7 opponents in foot races on 12 tracks, set across four different worlds.\r\n\r\nOffering frantic one-or-two player action, Rayman Rush's courses are filled with shortcuts and bonus items to liven up the action, while deadly obstacles litter your path and opponents try and hamper your progress with their various weapons. What's more, there are several different modes available, including Time Attack, Target Mode, and Lum Mode, providing a variety of different challenges on every track. Oozing the trademark graphical charm we've come to expect from the series, Rayman Rush offers multiplayer race fans a refreshing alternative from the norm.",

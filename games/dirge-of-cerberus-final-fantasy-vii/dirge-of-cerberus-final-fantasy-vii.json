  "description": "Get ready for the action-packed thrill ride of the summer, courtesy of the masterminds behind the original Final Fantasy VII. Breakout star Vincent Valentine returns in this adrenaline-fueled rampage that propels players into the middle of an ongoing conflict that threatens all life on the planet. Three years after the events of Final Fantasy VII, an unknown group of seemingly unstoppable soldiers appears, bringing a swift and bitter end to the peace enjoyed by the people of the world. The members of this enigmatic group are the ones who were trapped under the ruins of Midgar for three long years—the Deepground soldiers. Vincent Valentine finds himself pursued by several elite members of the mysterious Deepground organization. An unrelenting chain of events leads Vincent to the truth behind his past—and forces him once again to be the key player in a battle for the planet itself and all those living on it.",

  "description": "Burnout is an arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series. In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with.\r\n\r\nThere are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA. There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups. However, they are not based on real makes and models.\r\n\r\nOne notable feature of Burnout is the \"Burn Meter.\" The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners. Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost. If you crash, however the Burn Meter is reset and must be filled again to achieve boost.",

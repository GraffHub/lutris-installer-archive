  "description": "Includes 25 fantastic bundled tracks!! Or, race your own music...\r\n\r\nInspired by some of our favourite games like Wipeout, Trackmania, Vib-Ribbon and Audiosurfâ€¦\r\n\r\nRiff Racer is a high-octane music based racing game where we create racetracks from the songs in your music library.\r\n\r\nNot a rhythm game, but a fresh twist on music-powered game creation. Action on track is synced to the audio, you literally have to race the music to stay in time and score points.\r\n\r\nYou've seen other music powered games, Riff Racer takes the concept to the next level with our innovative MEGA engine. It takes any audio file, analyses it down to its core components and creates a unique racing experience from the structure of the song.\r\n\r\nVerses, choruses and drops become checkpoints, and the environment and cars are styled to the genre of music you're playing.",

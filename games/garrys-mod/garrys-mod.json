  "description": "Garry's Mod is a physics sandbox. There aren't any predefined aims or goals. We give you the tools and leave you to play.\r\n\r\nYou spawn objects and weld them together to create your own contraptions - whether that's a car, a rocket, a catapult or something that doesn't have a name yet - that's up to you. You can do it offline, or join the thousands of players who play online each day.\r\n\r\nIf you're not too great at construction - don't worry! You can place a variety of characters in silly positions. But if you want to do more, we have the means.",

  "description": "Based off the third book and movie of the series, players now take control of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in this 3D adventure as they face the dangers of their third year of Hogwarts, avoiding the soul-stealing Dementors, and trying to solve the mystery of escaped convict Sirius Black.\r\n\r\nPlayers will navigate through the castle of Hogwarts and beyond, as they learn new spells and how to work together as a team, solving multiple puzzles and avoiding traps that will either require teamwork, or one of the kid's particular skills. Harry can leap across chasms and climb ropes. Ron can sense secret areas. Hermione, being the smallest, can fit into areas where the others can't. Players can also control Hedwig the owl, or Buckbeak the hippogriff to accomplish other tasks and overcome obstacles.\r\n\r\nSurvive the year, learn new spells, and discover the truth of Sirius Black's role during the night Harry became known as \"The Boy Who Lived\".",

  "description": "Pokémon Prism is a super customized Pokémon Crystal romhack that takes place in a previously unexplored region. It contains new mechanics unseen in its inspired franchise, while refining existing gameplay.\r\n\r\nBoasting an expansive landscape to adventure in filled with unique challenges, fresh areas to explore, and new ways to play, Pokémon Prism is an entirely new experience that gamers of all ages are sure to enjoy!\r\n\r\nIn late 2016, the source code for Prism was unfortunately leaked online when original development stopped. A small team, independant of the original developers, formed to piece the rest of the code together to finish this 9 year legacy. With some of the best known Gameboy and Pokémon developers, RainbowDevs hopes to improve, fix, and maintain this massive project. Left in the code were remains of planned features, new areas, and undocumented changes. These are the basis for the new team's effort in an attempt to honor, and respect, the original creator's vision.",

After each mission, you use your points earned to purchase new units and Commanding Officers, that add an additional level of power and experience for your army (whether it be greater strength, faster response times or stronger attack ability).\r\n\r\nYou can also create your own maps for Skirmish mode, and take on up to 4 players in a battle royal.",

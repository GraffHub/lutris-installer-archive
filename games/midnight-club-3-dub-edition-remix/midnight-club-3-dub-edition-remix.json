  "description": "Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition is a racing game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. It is the third installment in the Midnight Club series. Like previous installments in the series, the game is an arcade-style racer and focuses on wild, high-speed racing, rather than realistic physics and driving. The name is derived from a partnership between Rockstar and DUB Magazine, which features heavily in the game in the form of DUB-sponsored races and DUB-customized vehicles as prizes. \r\nPlayers race through open world recreations of San Diego, Atlanta and Detroit listening to 98 (124 in the Remix version) licensed music tracks that include hip-hop, rock, and more.[citation needed] The game features a number of graphical views after the player crashes into certain objects, or travels across particular stretches of road. There is also the ability to customize a player's vehicle. Other than modifying the external looks, the vehicle's performance can also be improved (with the exception of all 'A' Class vehicles except motorcycles). Midnight Club 3: Dub Edition is the first game in the series to feature licensed vehicles.",

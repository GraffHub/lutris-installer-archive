  "description": "Marathon Infinity takes the closed universe of the Marathon series and blows it wide open. The solo/co-op campaign, \"Blood Tides of Lh'owon,\" is a 20-level scenario sporting new textures, weapons, and aliens. More than that, the scenario sheds a surprising new light on the story's characters and the meaning of events. Having defeated the Pfhor and reawakening the ancient remnants of the S'pht, the player now faces a world where friends become enemies and all is not what it seems...\r\n\r\nMarathon Infinity is the most popular Marathon game in online play, and is compatible with hundreds of community-made maps. This release includes the classic graphics, and revamped high-definition textures and weapons.",

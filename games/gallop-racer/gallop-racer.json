  "description": "Just like in real horse racing, no two races are alike: race outcomes are determined by racetrack, conditions, pack and luck. A great party game for players and spectators alike, you can be the jockey, or select watch mode, and be a spectator. As the jockey, you decide when to hold back, move inside, move outside and go for the lead - horses even change lanes, get bumped, get blocked and lose ground on curves. The winners are put out to stud, and the losers, put out to pasture.",

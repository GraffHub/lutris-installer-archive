  "description": "King's Quest I: Quest for the Crown, a revolutionary game designed by Roberta Williams and first released in 1984, epitomizes the classic adventure gaming experience. This game was the first of its kind which allowed the player to interact in an entirely original 2.5D world, and can be credited as the game that started graphic adventure gaming on the PC. Though the original AGI parser-based version is outdated and primitive-looking by today's gaming standards, in 1984 it was revolutionary. King's Quest I was not only groundbreaking, but also history in the making. It was followed by seven sequels bearing the King's Quest title.",

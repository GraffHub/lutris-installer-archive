  "description": "CavePacker is a Sokoban game - one of the most popular puzzle and logic games.\r\n\r\nKeep your cave tidy. To do this, make sure that all the spreaded packages are put onto their targets. You can only push, pulling is not allowed.\r\nYou get higher ratings for lesser moves you need. The first few maps might be easy to solve - but the more you progress in the game, the harder the maps will be.\r\n\r\nThere is also a multiplayer mode available",

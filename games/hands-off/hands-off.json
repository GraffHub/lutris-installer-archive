  "description": "The gloves are off. The gauntlet is down. Hands Off! asks â€œHow ambidextrous are you?\" and then forces you to prove it.\r\n\r\nHand to hand, you and your opponent are locked in a never ending struggle* to get coloured pegs into their matching coloured holes. You could assume that achieving this wouldn't be difficult. That assumption would be incorrect.\r\n\r\nHands Off! will strain your brain. Three holes, three pegs, four hands (two each!) - that's a lot of things to keep your eyes glued to (literally or figuratively). You can team up with a friend and share your hands, offloading some of your brain strain and struggling with teamwork and cooperation instead.\r\n\r\n*individual struggles do in-fact, end\r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n* Compete with your friends in frantic multiplayer battles\r\n* Use your hands (and your brain) in ways you're not used to\r\n* Experience a wide variety of arena shapes, themes and behaviours (around 30 possible permutations!)\r\n* Smack the Meddle buttons in each arena to mix up the gameplay (and your brains)\r\n* Challenge a friend to a one-on-one peg-in-hole battle or play the party modes for 2-4 players (party modes coming in v1.2)",

  "description": "Perspective is an experimental puzzle video game that includes aspects of a 2-dimensional platform game. The player moves the avatar through a 2D screen that changes based on the player's camera angle in 3D space. This perspective-shifting mechanic is used to reach a goal at the end of each level. When the player takes control of the camera angle, the 2D avatar is locked in place until the player decides to return to 2D mode.",

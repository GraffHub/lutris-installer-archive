  "description": "The movie; Plan 9.....the critics hated it. But, the producer of the film has noticed that it's been stolen by Bela Lugosi's double. Find him. Track him. For God's sake - just keep a straight head when you enter this part of the movie lot and town. Some of the most misguided people roam here! Most important.....get the film back!",

You got up in the morning, slaughtered the enemy until noon, had a nice lunch, a short nap, and then suited up for an afternoon of carnage and bloodshed. No more. Now the no-good, peace-nik, leaf-eating Ethereals are tellling everyone that they'd better clean up the world, put away their weapons and live in harmony -- or else. That means you gotta be SNEAKY.\r\n\r\n3-D SVGA terrain 4-Player network 30 planets to 'restore' Bio-genetically cross breed 5 types of creatures Control 4 different characters (Engineer, Ranger, Botanist and Geneticist)",

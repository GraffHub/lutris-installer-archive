  "description": "When the evil Dr. Cortex, orbiting way out in space, unleashes the horrific powers of his fiendish shrinking ray, our beloved planet shrinks to the size of a common grapefruit. Despite the benefits of such a setup (i.e., quicker commutes to your local Nintendo retailer), the negatives of a nanosized earth quickly become glaringly obvious.\r\n\r\nCrash's Einsteinian sister Coco develops a device that can return earth and its inhabitants to their rightful sizes, but powering it requires crystals from all over the world. Enter the redoubtable Crash. Globe-trotting from a Mayan Jungle to Arctic Caverns, Crash must gather the crystals in 20 richly varied levels.\r\n\r\nCrash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure's gameplay runs the gamut from side-scrolling to 3D chase to aerial combat sequences. This may be Crash's first appearance on a Nintendo console, but the brash bandicoot is definitely not afraid to go all-out in his premiere performance.",

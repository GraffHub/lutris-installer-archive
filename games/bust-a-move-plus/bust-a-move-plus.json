  "description": "BUST-A-MOVE comes to WiiWare with BUST-A-MOVE Plus!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUST-A-MOVE Plus! is a simple but hugely addictive puzzle game in which you must try to burst a multicolored mass of bubbles with your very own bubble launcher! Every time you make a group of three or more bubbles of the same color, they pop! There are two game modes available: 1P Puzzle, where players tackle the game’s 135 stages in pursuit of a new high score or best time; and Battle, in which players take on friends or computer-controlled opponents. And if all of that doesn’t satisfy your passion for popping, there are a total of 270 extra stages waiting for you in the two purchasable add-on-content packs! That’s 135 new stages per pack! BUST-A-MOVE Plus! is simple to get into and deep enough to keep you coming back for more, so what are you waiting for!?\r\n\r\nIn-game content available for purchase using stored account funds.",

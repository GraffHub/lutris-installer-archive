  "description": "Nicky\r\n\r\nThis is a very fun action and challenging strategy game in which you have to carefully calculate your movements to get to the end of the trail.\r\nEach time you play this game, you earn skills and knowledge to finish the challenge in less movements.\r\n\r\nIf you like challenging games and mini-golf games, this is certainly for you!\r\n\r\nThe commands are very simple, only the mouse is used and anyone can play easily. You need to click, drag, aim and release.\r\n\r\nBe careful, you certainly don't want to move backwards, because that would make you perform a lot more of movements.\r\n\r\nThe game is recommended to everyone, there is no violence in this game, but some people may not know how to deal well with the frustration of falling from some high place or some objects that will puzzle you up along the way =) .\r\n\r\nThe gameplay time can vary according to the abilities of each person in rolling a golf ball.\r\n\r\nThere is a world ranking with the 10 players that finish the game in less movement. This ranking is monthly, so each month it is reset and new people have the opportunity to have their names placed in the ranking.\r\n\r\nNicky is a little golf ball that needs your help. The game is set in several places, wich begins in a interior of a house, then you have to find a way to his homeland.",

  "description": "In Tropical Fish, the player will transfer fish from one aquarium to another one via a fish bowl in a game similar to the previously released Fire. If a fish drops on the floor, the cat (similar in appearance to the one from Chef) will take it for himself as a tasty snack. The cat also appears as the alarm clock icon. When the game begins, fish will start jumping from the water tank on the right. As the player, they must make sure that they catch the fish in the fish bowl. Shortly after this, the fish will jump from the water bowl to the left, and the player will have to keep on catching it until it reaches the other water tank.\r\n\r\nOne point is rewarded to the player for each fish they catch and each fish they transfer to a fish tank. The maximum amount of points a player can receive is 9,999.",

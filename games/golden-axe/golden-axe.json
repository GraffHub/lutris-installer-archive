  "description": "In Turtle Village, the invaders are ugly, brutal and 12 feet tall. They roar with laughter as they pound you into the dirt. Swing Axe Battler's mighty sword and shatter them with Mushroom Magic. Smash and blast with Tyris Flare's Curtains of Fire. Somersault and strike with Gilius Thunderhead's axe or scorch the brutes with lightning!\r\n\r\nIt's a spellbinding age of magic, fiery dragons and skeletons in armor. Battle the invaders on the back of a giant turtle. Fight on the feathered wings of a soaring eagle. Conquer and ride flame-spewing monsters to victory!\r\n\r\nRescue the kidnapped King and Princess to return peace to the world. The score is Death Adder, thousands -- you, zero. Grab your weapon and change the score!",

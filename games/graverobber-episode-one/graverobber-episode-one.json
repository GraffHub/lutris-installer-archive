  "description": "Seattle. 1990-something. Sometime past midnight.\r\n\r\nGrave robbing is what Sasha's best at. Top of his class and nationally infamous. But after a tomb heist goes not-so-smoothly, he's suddenly being haunted by Ellery, the ghost of the particular crypt he robbed.\r\n\r\nNot wanting to give back the stolen watch, Sasha delves into research about Ellery's past along with looking for a means to get rid of him. He unexpectedly becomes more and more intrigued by Ellery's past while he was alive. Meanwhile, the ghost attempts to make Sasha's life as miserable as possible and an obsessive detective uses whatever means possible to find the graverobber and arrest him.\r\n\r\nSasha's only two friends and hope for safety are a skeevy bartender named Barnaby, and his very own wits.",

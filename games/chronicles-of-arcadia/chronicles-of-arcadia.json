  "description": "Taborea was born when Ayvenas began recording his visions of an\r\nextraordinary world in a book. As he wrote, the god created\r\npeaceful races and idyllic lands for them to inhabit.\r\nBut, as we all know, a happy story is a boring story,\r\nso one day he had a thought that\r\nwould prove very dangerous indeed:\r\n\r\n“What if the story weren’t so peaceful?”\r\nThis insidious thought so consumed him that he began painting Taborea in a darker palette of colours: Wise men became fools, gentle elves developed brutal tendencies and gracious dwarves were spoilt with greed. Even the provisions intended to protect the creatures of Taborea were twisted and corrupted.\r\n\r\nAyvenas recognised the gravity of his interference in a world no longer under his control, so he decided to let the Taboreans write their own ending to the story. He tore the unwritten pages into pieces and scattered them across the land – and thus began a new era",

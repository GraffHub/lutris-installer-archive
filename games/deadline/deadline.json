  "description": "DEADLINE pits you, the keen-eyed sleuth, against a 12-hour time limit to solve a classic locked-door mystery. Infocom literally puts the case in your hands, providing you with a dossier containing lab reports, police findings, dastardly-looking pills, and more. Once you embark on your investigation, you must sift through a myriad of clues and motives in order to track down the killer. No easy feat, for all six of your suspects exercise free will - coming and going, scheming and maneuvering independent of your actions. The NEW YORK TIMES' verdict says it all: DEADLINE is an \"amazing feat of programming.\"",

  "description": "The search for Eco\r\n\r\nWith the Eco of their world in dangerously short supply, Jak, Daxter and Keira jump into the Hellcat and set off for the Brink - the very edge of the world - in search of a new source.\r\n\r\nAfter defending the ACS Behemoth from sky pirates, they board and meet Duke Skyheed, who invites them to the grand city of Aeropa. There, they are offered the Eco Seeker - a device that could lead them to the precious Eco their world craves - as long as Jak passes a series of trials.\r\n\r\nHe succeeds, only for Captain Phoenix to attack, kidnapping Keira and the Eco Seeker. Jak and Daxter must take to the skies, rescue their friend and use the Eco Seeker to save their world.",

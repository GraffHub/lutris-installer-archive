  "description": "ATTACK LEFT or ATTACK RIGHT\r\n\r\nWe want to show that a fighting game can be complex without cumbersome button combinations. Once players complete the tutorial levels and learn the basics, they'll see that this is the most intense two-button game ever made.\r\n\r\nWith a 1000 different animations available, literally, anything is possibleâ€”particularly when players unlock each of the 26 available skills. Having these skills available simultaneously is a major design challenge that encompasses the core of what OFDP2 is trying to achieve. Seeing the game with all 26 skills is a spectacle unique to OFDP2.\r\n\r\nWe built this game as a palette cleanser between other games in your library. It was designed to deliver a quick hit of adrenaline as fast as possible.\r\n\r\nYou can't get a feel for the gameplay from watching videos. The flow of combat is something we spent years tweaking. It's what makes OFDP2 unique. Only by playing it will this become clear. That's why it's important to us that you TRY THE DEMO out before you consider purchasing this game.\r\n\r\n*You can turn the announcer on or off in the options.",

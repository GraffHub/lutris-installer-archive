  "description": "Ciel, the protagonist, is a princess who has never been allowed to leave her kingdom. Along with her loyal knight and bodyguard and (unknowingly to her) a certain third/fourth wheeler, she decides to follow her dreams of seeing the world.\r\n\r\nIt's a very pure story so expect fluff, but know there is mild blood for a short time in the game! Also, beware of the many puns in the game. I'm warning you now so you don't want to... /pun/ch me in the face later.\r\n\r\nYou can unlock Yvin's route after finishing either Florien or Anton's!\r\n\r\nThis game is extremely straightforward, so there's no walkthrough necessary.",

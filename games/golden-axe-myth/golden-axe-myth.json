  "description": "The Empire of the Joined Lands has been the real symbol of wealth and power since a long time ago. But now, evil creeped into heart of the Empire, and the Golden Axe was stolen. The council of Defensors was tricked and misguided. The four best warriors of the whole realm are already on pursuit of the enemy. The council gave them the power of Elemental Magick, since great are the dangers they'll have to face. They know no fear or doubt. In their hearts and minds there's only the sacred quest: to get back the Golden Axe.",

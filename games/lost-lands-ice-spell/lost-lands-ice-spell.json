Weather cataclysm, mythical creatures, ancient legends - these and more stands before the main hero of the Lost Lands.\r\n\r\n\"Lost Lands: Ice Spell\" is a fantasy-world adventure game with lots of hidden-objects, mini-games and puzzles to solve.\r\n\r\nThe cold has come to the Lost Lands in the middle of the summer. Folk are hiding inside, trying to warm their homes. All the living is frozen, all the flowers are gone, the crops are dead and the birds are running for their lives. Old people say: \"The spirit of the Frozen Mountains has awoken...\"\r\nBut nobody expects the reason be dug deep in the ancient history of the Lost Lands, when the world was young. And yet an ancient force was awaken by the common from our world.\r\nWizard Maaron has called upon the only link between both worlds - Susan.",

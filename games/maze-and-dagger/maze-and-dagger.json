Find weapons, potions, and armor hidden in the maze to aid you on your quest to find the exit!\r\n\r\nAdvance through increasingly difficult mazes full of skeletons, traps and more. Take your pick of either normal or hardcore mode. In normal mode, when you die, you drop your items and restart the current maze. In hardcore mode, when you die, you lose all your progress. Compete on the leaderboards for the hardest maze completed!\r\n\r\nEach time you play, expect a different experience. Every maze is completely unique and randomly generated.\r\n\r\nEstimated time to complete each maze:\r\nMaze 1: 30 seconds\r\nMaze 5: 2 minutes\r\nMaze 10: 8 minutes\r\nMaze 15: 20 minutes\r\n... ad infinitum\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n\r\n    Unlimited unique mazes (randomly generated)\r\n    Full ACTION (no crafting nonsense)\r\n    Traps\r\n    Weapons\r\n    Potions\r\n    Armor\r\n    Normal mode\r\n    Hardcore mode (death resets progress, separate leaderboard)\r\n    Game save/load\r\n    MORE TO COME â€“ leave your ideas in the discussion boards!\r\n\r\nðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®ðŸŽ®\r\nMac: PS4, XBox360, Steam Controller\r\nWindows: PS4, XBox360, Steam Controller\r\nLinux: Steam Controller",

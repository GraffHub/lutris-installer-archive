Free form construction play allows you to complete your objective in many different ways. There are two levels of difficulty and three view perspectives. The game allows you to create and print personalized certificates as well as customize the inside of your vehicle. A custom hardware controller can be attached to your keyboard, making it look like the cockpit of a Caterpillar vehicle.",

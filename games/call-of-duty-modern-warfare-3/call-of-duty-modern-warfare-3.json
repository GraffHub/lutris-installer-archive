  "description": "The eighth main entry into the Call of Duty series, and the third in the Modern Warfare sub series, Modern Warfare 3 is a direct sequel to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. In this first-person shooter the story picks up at the end of the previous game as Russia's invasion into the United States continues, but the war has now engulfed Europe, with Great Britain, France and Germany participating, allied to the US. The player once again takes on the role of various characters throughout the campaign, including 'Soap' Mctavish from the previous game, as well as several new ones, including Frost and Sandman, members of the US Delta Force.\r\n\r\nNext to the main story campaign with its scripted gameplay, MW3 features two cooperative game modes. The first is Spec Ops, making a return from the previous game. It has the players perform brief missions and a star is awarded based on the performance. The second is the new Survival Mode, where players fight off different waves of enemy soldiers which get progressively harder.",

  "description": "In Elephant in the Room you are the elephant in the room. Literally. It's up to you to get out of the house without being acknowledged. Use your powerful pachyderm skills to sneak around and make your way out. Your trunk is a versatile tool you can use to suck, blow, or move things around. You'll probably break a lot of things. Good luck!",

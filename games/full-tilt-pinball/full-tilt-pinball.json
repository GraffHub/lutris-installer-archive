  "description": "Full Tilt! Pinball is the first pinball simulation game developed by Cinematronics, LLC.\r\n\r\nThe game includes three boards:\r\nDragonâ€™s Keep - Medieval Fantasy theme;\r\nSkulduggery - Pirate theme;\r\nSpace Cadet - Space ship commander theme.\r\nEach board features the usual amount of bumpers, targets, ramps, etc. as well as a big payoff for the successful completion of each table, such as slaying a dragon in Dragon's Keep, or creating a black hole in Space Cadet. Different sounds and music are incorporated for the individual tables.\r\n\r\nThe games are played using keyboard keys and include being able to nudge the tables. Being too forceful with a nudge will result in a tilt and end that turn.",

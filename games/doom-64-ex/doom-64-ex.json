  "description": "What is Doom 64?\r\n\r\nDeveloped by Midway – San Diego, Doom 64 is a unofficial sequel to Doom II developed for the Nintendo 64 and was released in March ’97. Based on the Jaguar and Playstation code base, Doom 64 is considered the most technically advanced Doom game of its time. In addition to the completely revamped rendering engine, Doom 64 went through numerous changes and improvements from that of Doom II. No graphics or sounds from Doom II have been reused in Doom 64; instead, it features completely new sprites, textures, levels and sounds and features a completely different art style.\r\nWhat is Doom 64 EX?\r\n\r\nDoom 64 EX is a faithful recreation of the original game using the Doom source code as the base with the benefit from newer control methods like mouse look, high resolutions and color depth. In addition to that, Doom 64 EX will also feature mod support to allow users to create custom levels, textures and sprites. Doom 64 EX is also aimed to be 100% accurate to the original game as close as possible and offer some PC-specific features that can enhance the game.",

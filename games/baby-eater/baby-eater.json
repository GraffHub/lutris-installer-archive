Forced to watch her family die, she refused to bow to the Queen's whims. Punishing her, the Queen sealed Procuni in a sarcophagus and forced to dream the same nightmare every night - the nightmare of babes falling from the heavens, to die and feed the lust of QUEEN SAPHRON!\r\n\r\nThis game uses or emulates 8 bit rules where appropriate, to give an authentic 8-bit experience!

Whether it involves intelligence and finesse or stamina and brute force, the Blitzkrieg Anthology is your theater of operations where youâ€™ll showcase your strategic style. Launch surgically precise attacks to cripple your foe with strategic tank and air assaults while maintaining your offensive momentum. Ever wanted to see if you are a better strategist than General Erwin Rommel? Or would you prefer to side with the American legend General George S. Patton? Take the fight to authentic and painstakingly researched historical campaigns such as Tripoli, El Alamein, or even the famous Battle of the Bulge!\r\n\r\nOnce you have mastered the single-player campaigns, you can use the map editor included with the game and create your own maps or take the battle over LAN or direct IP, or multiplayer over LAN!",

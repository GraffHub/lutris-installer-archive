  "description": "Rally driving takes to the high road! Choose a Pininfarina-styled Ferrari 550 Marinello, a rear-drive coupe that will slide over the tarmac like a hot knife through butter. Take a fast car on some of the fastest roads in Europe, and past some of the slowest drivers.\r\n\r\nWith all the hazards of the ordinary roads, but with all the excitement of high-powered rallying, this takes the Need for Speed series to new roads and new adventures.\r\n\r\nIt may start out as a sunny afternoon pleasure drive, but once you find out what the Ferrari can do, you won't want to hang around.\r\n\r\nWhether you're racing against an opponent, or simply trying to beat your own personal best, the need for challenge will grip you tighter than your seatbelt in an emergency stop. Not that stopping is recommended. Not with this one. Race to a new dimension.",

It is sometimes called simply Duke Nukem for PlayStation and is the first port of this nature. It is also a standalone expansion pack that features new music, some new enemies, and an exclusive fourth episode: Plug 'N' Pray.\r\n\r\nThe port features all three episodes of the original game, plus one additional episode: Plug 'N' Pray, which includes six extra levels and a secret level. The secret level was also included in the PC version. It features a complete re-rendering of all the weapons and enemies, and a combination of bespoke and rearranged music, some rearranged from the PC version, and some original, in XA streaming audio made by Mark 'madfiddler' Knight, Gamesounds.co.uk.",

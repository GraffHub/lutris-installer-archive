  "description": "Project Zomboid is an open-ended zombie-infested sandbox. It asks one simple question – how will you die?\r\n\r\nIn the towns of Muldraugh and West Point, survivors must loot houses, build defences and do their utmost to delay their inevitable death day by day. No help is coming – your continued survival relies on your own cunning, luck and ability to evade a relentless horde.",

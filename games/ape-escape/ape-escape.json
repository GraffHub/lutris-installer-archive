  "description": "YOU BETTER GET THEM BEFORE THEY GET YOU!\r\n\r\nA boisterous band of baboons carry out a daring zoo escape. It's ape anarchy and it's up to YOU to stop the chimps before they make chumps out of the human race!\r\n\r\n* The first and only game that takes full advantage of the DUAL SHOCK analog controller!\r\n* Use both analog sticks â€“ rotate 'em, sling 'em back and push 'em down for unequaled and revolutionary controller action!\r\n* Hunt down over 200 unruly apes.\r\n* Operate great gadgets! A Tank, a Remote Control car, a Stun Club and Time Net, a SkyFlyer, a Slingshot, a Monkey Radar and more!\r\n* Bonus rounds, mind-twisting mini games and clock racing time attacks for unbelievable fun.",

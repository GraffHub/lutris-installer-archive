  "description": "Suganuma Shoichi was a violinist who showed talent from a young age, and joined an orchestra abroad with great hopes for his future – until one day, when a certain incident caused him to lose everything there…… \r\n\r\nWith his path as a musician sealed off, Shoichi gave up his beloved violin and returned home in despair. But having been driving out of the orchestra, he incited his father’s rage and found himself disowned, leaving him with no place left to go.\r\n\r\nBy unexpected chance, he came to be a live-in worker at a live house, and Shoichi came in contact with a world he’d never known. \r\n\r\nIn this completely new environment, he meets many clumsy people who have continued to assert their individual ways of life and music. Through living together with them, he begins to string his life back together, forming new bonds and finding leads towards a new future. \r\n\r\nWhen Shoichi and the friends he was destined to meet overcome their pasts and the trials before them, how will they grow as individuals, let alone as a band? \r\n\r\nA new world spreads from the live house as these musicians in their prime journey through a tale of rock’n’roll and aim for new heights as they discover themselves deep within.",

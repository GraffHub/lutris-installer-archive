There is talk of an alien invasion - people claim to have seen flying saucers and hi-tech guided missiles. Who can we depend on to swab the sky clean of danger? You guessed it... Swabby is back!\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. You guide Swabby the snail through different areas of increasing difficulty, while shooting down asteroids, missiles and even the occasional UFO. Be sure to grab the juice, cakes and other bakery goodies – they will boost your score and make Swabby shoot even faster. Don’t let the flaming asteroids (the so-called spinners) reach the ground!",

  "description": "A Mystery Unsolved Until Now.\r\nSince August 31, 1888 the identity of Jack the Ripper has eluded criminologists. Using the actual clues and evidence assembled from years of painstaking research, now you can solve the mystery. Travel around authentic Victorian London locations in search of clues and interview over one hundred actual persons and suspects. Only you can stop Jack before he strikes again.\r\n\r\nOnly Logic and Deduction Can Save You!\r\nNo sentence typing or complicated and frustrating parsers are used to solve the mystery. Use a click & drag interface to arrange the facts that you uncover. Be forewarned because the facts may not take you where you expect. Three levels of difficulty and multiple solutions will keep you thinking for a long, long time.\r\n\r\nAlone in the Alleyways of Whitechapel!\r\nArtists have painstakingly reconstructed the actual murder locations and haunts of Jack the Ripper from long-lost photographs and blueprints to authentically recreate the eerie ambience of Whitechapel in 1888.",

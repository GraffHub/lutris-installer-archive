  "description": "A remake of the Super Famicom role-playing game, Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation is based on the same engine already used for the DS remakes of its two predecessors, Chapters of the Chosen and Hand of the Heavenly Bride. The game features elaborate 2D sprite animation set in full 3D environments.\r\n\r\nPlayers set out to counter the threat of a demon overlord by exploring a top-down view world map and dungeons and meet colorful monsters in turn-based, first-person view battles. Although the game's core gameplay is almost identical to that of others from the main series, instead of a day/night cycle it features two parallel game worlds, a growing team roster from which an adventuring party can be assembled as well as a class system later in the game for further customization.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a touch screen-based curling mini game as well as a message exchange system utilizing the DS' tag mode feature.",

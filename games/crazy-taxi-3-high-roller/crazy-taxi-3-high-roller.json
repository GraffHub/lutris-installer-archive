  "description": "Crazy Taxi 3 serves up more of the classic gameplay that made the series so popular on the Dreamcast. High Roller takes place in \"Glitter Oasis\" which is modeled after Las Vegas. You take the roll as one of 4 new drivers and you must try to deliver as many customers as possible to collect huge fares.\r\n\r\nCrazy Taxi 3 also includes reworked versions of the original 2 levels from Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2 -- West Coast and Small Apple each with their respective drivers. Also included is Crazy X mode in which you play through a slew of minigames for when you don't feel like tackling the main game.",

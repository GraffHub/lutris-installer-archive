  "description": "The year is 2112. Earth is losing its struggle against ruthless, sub-human space scavengers seeking mastery over every living creature. The only hope for the war-torn planet is to locate survivors scattered over the four corners of the globe, and organize them into an avenging army. With time running out, only the speed and skill of Mach Rider can reach them before all is lost.\r\n\r\nGAME PLAY: As Mach Rider, you are aware of the need for speed. So, in a desperate attempt to save the planet, you design your own course of action--one so difficult and fraught with danger that it would sorely test the strength and endurance of even the best of riders. You grip the handles of your cycle and, your face distorting with impelling force, accelerate to top speed. Every hairpin curve of your self-created daredevil course poses increasingly dangerous challenges and an endless array of ruthless villains determined to end your mission. But you are more determined. For Earth must not succumb to the vile space scavengers.",

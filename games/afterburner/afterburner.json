  "description": "a 1987 combat flight simulator arcade game designed by Yu Suzuki for Sega AM2. The player flies an F-14 (with moving seat, in some installations) using a specialized joystick. The game spawned several sequels\r\n\r\nThe game allows the player to control a F-14 Tomcat jet, which must destroy a series of enemy jets throughout 18 stages. At the start of the game, the player takes off from an aircraft carrier called the SEGA Enterprise, which shares a similar name to the one used in the 1986 film Top Gun (also a direct reference to the company's name at the time, SEGA Enterprises, LTD.).\r\n\r\nIn the arcade version, the jet itself employs a machine gun and a limited set of heat-seeking missiles, in the Master System version there is an unlimited number of missiles. These weapons are replenished by another aircraft after beating a few stages. The aircraft, cannon and missile buttons are all controlled from an integrated flight stick.",

  "description": "Olive Village... that was the name of this town, as well as this world.\r\nThis otherworldly town has a nostalgic, retro-like flavor.\r\nFor ages, it has prospered, and continues to prosper without end.\r\nEvery corner of the place is bustling with people, and warmth.\r\nIt is both old-fashioned, yet refreshingly new.\r\n\r\nNeither magic nor spells exist here, but there is an aura of mystique.\r\nHow long has it been since I, Yumesaki Haruki, have come to this world?\r\n\r\nIt feels like it's been a few days. But it also feels like it's been over a year.\r\nThere is the passing of the day into night, back into day.\r\nHowever, you don't feel the passage of time beyond that.\r\nThe flowers that have once blossomed continue to stay in full bloom.",

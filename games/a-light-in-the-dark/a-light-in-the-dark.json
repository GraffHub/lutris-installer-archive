  "description": "──We cannot choose in this unfair world.\r\n\r\nHao-Chen Jiang did not understand what it was when he opened his eyes. Before him was a dim and dreary room that he had not seen before. Trying to get up to turn on the lights, he finds that his arms are tied behind him and that is when he realizes that he's been kidnapped. It is then that a mysterious girl appears before him and with a look of disdain tells him that he's been kidnapped and unless his family agrees to pay a ransom he has no chance to escape. But perhaps there is more to this than just money...\r\n\r\nThe rich boy stuck in his never changing daily life...\r\nThe fierce girl struggling for survival...\r\nTwo people in totally opposite positions in life.\r\n\r\nDuring his days of imprisonment, they will learn of a world they were never aware of which will crumble away at their deep-rooted prejudices. In the face of confusion and the choices before them, what will they find...?\r\n\r\nA Light in the Dark is an original visual novel game from the creative minds of CreSpirit (Developers of Rabi-Ribi), Storia (Developers of Dong-jin Rice-hime) and Narrator (Developers of Companion).\r\n\r\nThe game features a story part and an interactive part where Hao-Chen can examine the items around him as he tries to formulate a plan to escape his kidnappers but beware of your stamina!

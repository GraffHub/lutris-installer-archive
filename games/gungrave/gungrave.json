  "description": "In Gungrave, you play Grave, a long dead assassin sent back from the dead to annihilate endless hordes of enemies. Players battle their way through massive areas filled with non-stop shooting foes in this anime-style, third person shooter.\r\n\r\nYou blast through the stages using your two weapons with unlimited ammo, and with your coffin, which can be used as a rocket launcher. The game keeps players pounding down on the square button, or just using the rapid fire option. \r\n\r\nThere area also various special types of shots in the game that are limited for each level. Also included in this game is a targeting system.",

  "description": "Similar to Bust-A-Move/Puzzle Bobble, Bubble Heroes is an action-puzzle game in which the player shoots randomly colored bubbles at the other bubbles above. Once 3 or more bubbles of the same color are in contact, they pop and are removed from the screen.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 game modes: Story, Championship (both single-player) and Death Match (two players). The player must also pick a character before the start of the action proper, each with their own special power: a brave knight, a cat girl or a prince turned into a frog.",

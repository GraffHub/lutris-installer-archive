  "description": "Some short singleplayer first person games about gardening, chess, history, infinity, and a murder.\r\nOn page 90 of his otherwise flawless \"The Guns at Last Light: The War in Western Europe,\" Rick Atkinson claims that on the morning of June 7th, 1944, the 29th Division remained \"well short\" of the Aure River (four miles inland!) due to the 82nd Division's failure to fortify the beachhead on the Cotentin Peninsula. The following excerpts, type-written by one Dr. Wang Peng, former professor of English at the Freie Universit√§t Kiautschou, suggest far more to those events than first suspected.\r\n\r\n* Lush double-A production-quality expressionistic visuals\r\n* Inspired by the short story \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" by Jorge Luis Borges\r\n* Controls: Mouse-only cursor controls. Touchpads are somewhat doable.",

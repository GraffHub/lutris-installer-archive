  "description": "From a queue of some 360 eager conscripts waiting to go to war, you'll hand pick 15 of them to volunteer for each mission. Shoot anything that moves, throw grenades, shoot bazookas, drive tanks, fly choppers, and die as you guide your troop of no-hopers through twenty-four missions, each with a different terrain and objective.\r\n\r\nIf you like maiming, killing and mindless violence, here's your chance to wipe out all 360 men in your own army, not to mention the enemy. War has never been so much fun!",

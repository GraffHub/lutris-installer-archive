  "description": "KPatience is a relaxing card sorting game. To win the game a player has to arrange a single deck of cards in certain order amongst each other.\r\n\r\nKPatience (Patience Card Game) is a card sorting game developed by KDE. As the name suggests, this is one game where all the player needs is patience. It is a collection of card sorting games where some may require the player to come up with a strategy to solve the game, or some games where the resolution depends on the fall of the cards from the deck. However, the common theme among all these games is that the player must sort the cards according to a specific order by turning, moving, or reordering them.",

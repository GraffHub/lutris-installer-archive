By uncovering an artifact whose powers they don’t fully understand, these remarkable kids will defy the laws of Nature and somehow interact between two planes of reality: life and death.\r\n\r\nTheir curiosity will trigger a series of unexpected events that will get them involved in a government conspiracy and a mysterious U.S. Army general with his own nefarious plans.",

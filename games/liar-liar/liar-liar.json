  "description": "Liar Liar, a game that I worked for five days on. The goal of the game is to aid Yukari, the heroine of this game to murder her boyfriend and get rid of anyone in your way!\r\n\r\nShallow plot, characters, and background characters galore, for a simple test just to understand how flags and if statements worked has exploded into something else. The game play should probably take roughly less than 15 minutes. There are three ways you can die, and there is only one true end.",

  "description": "Big Brain Academy: Wii Degree is the first installment to Nintendo's series of brain games to make it's debut on the Wii.\r\n\r\nUtilizing your Mii profiles from your Wii, you get to enroll them into the academy to test and improve your brain. Much like Big Brain Academy you are tested in five major brain activity areas: identify, memorize, analyze, compute, and visualize. The object is to measure your brain and to increase the size of it through practice sessions. By using the Wiimote you have to point at the screen to make your selections.",

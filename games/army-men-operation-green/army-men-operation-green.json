  "description": "In keeping with hallowed Army Men tradition, Operation Green pits you against the nefarious Tan army in mission-based action that sprawls across big levels.\r\n\r\nThe action is presented in a three-quarters view. Controls are on the sluggish side, so master side-stepping to anticipate and avoid enemy fire.\r\n\r\nYou can change items in battle by pressing select. Use the hand-held Minesweeper to clear a safe path through minefields. Blast enemy tents to uncover supplies, or just wait for the Green army to air-drop supplies.\r\n\r\nCheck maps frequently as you make your way through the big worlds.\r\n\r\nProgress is password-protected. Army Men: Operation Green is in stores now.",

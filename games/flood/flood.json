  "description": "Flood is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player takes control of Quiffy, a strange amphibious creature, on his quest to stop the flooding of his underground world. The gameplay is familiar (it is a platformer afterall), but there are some novel ideas, such as Quiffy's ability to cling to walls and ceilings.\r\n\r\nDuring his travel to the planet surface, Quiffy will meet three kinds of menace. The first is the monsters, of course, as in any platformer. The two others are a bit more original: as the game's title implies, water will progressively flood the levels, endagering Quiffy - which, by the way, isn't amphibious. There is also a ghost which happens to be the spirit of Quiffy's late aunt (!) and which will chase him by reproducing every move he made a dozen of seconds later.",

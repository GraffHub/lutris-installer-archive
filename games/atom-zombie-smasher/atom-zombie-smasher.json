The zombie apocalypse is upon us and it's up to you to evacuate everyone before they fall prey to the undead.\r\n\r\nConduct massive rescue operations with a helping hand from snipers, artillery crews, orbital bombardments, and more. Experience the tactical richness of fully-destructible environments and procedurally-generated campaigns.\r\n\r\nAnd when the apocalypse ends, create your own game mods and share them with the Online File Share.",

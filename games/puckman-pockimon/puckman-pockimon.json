  "description": "Puckman Pockimon, also known as Jing Ling Jia Zu (精靈家族, roughly translates to \"creature family\") in Chinese, is a pirated arcade made by Genie. \r\n\r\nThe game is almost identical to Pac-Man, with Pikachu as player 2 and different maze variations. The only other \"Pokémon\" part is some of the ghosts are replaced with the Pokémon Caterpie and Munchlax. Also, when you die, you have the option of respawning if you insert another coin; no progress will be lost.\r\n\r\nVarious powerups appear during the game, some of which include the ying-yang symbol which resets the current level's progress.",

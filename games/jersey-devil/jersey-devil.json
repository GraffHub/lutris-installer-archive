  "description": "Jersey City is in trouble when evil Dr. Knarf and his pumpkin headed-assistant Dennis, rule. Dr. Knarf creates evil mutant vegetables that run amok within the city. And only the famous devil can now save the city .\r\n\r\nThe game's theme is Halloween, and the objective is to catch Dr. Knarf. The player will need to open \"K\" Locks using color keys with letters \"K\" \"N\" \"A\" R\" and \"F\" (which makes Knarf). Every area in Jersey City has two levels, each with its own boss (or bosses). These areas include the Art Museum, the City Park, the Graveyard, the Factory, the Seaport and Knarf's own forest.\r\n\r\nThe player can also free the hostages that were captured by Knarf's army (including children). Nitro Crates can be picked up to enhance the devil's strength. For a 100% game completion the player needs to beat all areas, find and beat all secret levels, free all hostages, destroy all nitro crates in all levels, and collect the golden Knarf tokens from all levels.",

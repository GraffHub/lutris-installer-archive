  "description": "Gals Panic S2 is the sixth arcade game in the Gals Panic series. Like Gals Panic S: Extra Edition, the models are anime-style rather than photographic or realistically drawn. As always, the goal is to uncover an image under a silhouette by cutting off portions via Qix-like gameplay. This is hindered by bizarre enemies who attack the cursor. Items are collected when the player cuts out a space containing them. The panic attack system and EXTRA coins return, with some minor changes.",

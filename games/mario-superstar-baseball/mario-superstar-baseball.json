  "description": "Mario Superstar Baseball, known in Japan as Super Mario Stadium Miracle Baseball (スーパーマリオスタジアム ミラクルベースボール Sūpā Mario Sutajiamu Mirakuru Bēsubōru) is a sports game that was developed by Namco and Now Production and published by Nintendo for the GameCube in 2005. The game was created in the vein of other Mario sports games such as Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour and Mario Power Tennis. This game is now a Player's Choice title. A sequel, Mario Super Sluggers, was released for the Wii in 2008.[1]\r\n\r\nGameplay mainly focuses on the player assuming the role of many Mario series characters to challenge any opposing teams compatible in the Challenge Mode, the final being Bowser, having baseball matches to see who will win the Cup of the mode. Other playable modes include Exhibition Mode, in which players choose the leader and the other rosters in the team and challenge another team to a single baseball game, and Minigames where the player must complete a certain mission. A common power-up in the game is a charged swing, a hit by a baseball bat performed by a character that will give the ball a strong hit, causing the length of a normal hit baseball to be twice as powerful.\r\n\r\nOverall, the game was well received by critics, gaining an 8 out of 10 from GameSpot.[2]",

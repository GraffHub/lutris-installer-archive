  "description": "Hi, Monika here!\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Literature Club! It's always been a dream of mine to make something special out of the things I love. Now that you're a club member, you can help me make that dream come true in this cute game!\r\n\r\nEvery day is full of chit-chat and fun activities with all of my adorable and unique club members:\r\n\r\nSayori, the youthful bundle of sunshine who values happiness the most;\r\nNatsuki, the deceivingly cute girl who packs an assertive punch;\r\nYuri, the timid and mysterious one who finds comfort in the world of books;\r\n...And, of course, Monika, the leader of the club! That's me!\r\n\r\nI'm super excited for you to make friends with everyone and help the Literature Club become a more intimate place for all my members. But I can tell already that you're a sweetheart—will you promise to spend the most time with me? ♥",

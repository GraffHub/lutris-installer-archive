  "description": "Turtle Bridge is a widescreen Game & Watch video game released in 1982 by Nintendo. In the game, you must get the character from one side of a lake to the other by jumping on the shells of turtles that are protruding from the water. If you jump on a turtle at the wrong time, then you will have to go back to the beginning. The fact that the turtles gain your character access to the other side of the lake is where the game's name originates from",

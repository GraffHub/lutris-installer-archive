I spend my days at work doing artsy computer graphics stuff, and at night I unwind by doingâ€¦  artsy computer graphics stuff.  If there exists an opposite to Attention-Deficit-Disorder, I believe I am afflicted.  This may also explain my tendency to listen to individual songs on loop for extended periods of time.",

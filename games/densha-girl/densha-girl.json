  "description": "Densha girl is a game made (mostly) in 24 hours by NewWestGames and other contributors from the Beam.pro community.\r\n\r\nIt follows the story of Hana, a deliquent at school who rarely goes in. Whenever she does though, she sees a beautiful blonde girl on her way home every day. This is a romantic tale with 18+ content (Note all characters are over 18.)\r\n\r\nNow on sale over on Steam! The remastered version, The Girl on the Train features much redrawn art, an improved and extended script, and brand new CGs! This is more for posterity, and as a real freebie!",

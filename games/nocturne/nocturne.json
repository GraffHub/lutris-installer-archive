Werewolves, vampires, ghouls and flesh-eating zombies lurk in every darkened corner and under every unlit stairwell, their bloodlust sated only when preying on the innocent.\r\n\r\nAs an agent of The Spookhouse, a secret government agency that investigates the forces of darkness and evil, you have one purpose. To seek out and destroy these creatures. And you hunt, as your vile quarry does, at night...\r\n\r\n+ Hunt and destroy over forty types of foul creature in a wide variety of environments ranging from eerie, mountaing top castles to dank, subterranean temples.\r\n\r\n+ Explore the lairs of the damned through intelligent, cinematic cameras and first-person night-vision goggles.\r\n\r\n+ Brave four individual tales of horrific adventure, each with its own unique characterisation and plot.\r\n\r\n+ Experience horror as you have never imagined it by creeping through the most realistic shadows, rolling fog and dramatic lighting ever created.",

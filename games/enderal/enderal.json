  "description": "Enderal (to be released July 1-3 of 2016 - English version some weeks later) is a total conversion for TES V: Skyrim: a game modification that is set in its own world with its own landscape, lore and story. It offers an immersive open world, all for the player to explore, overhauled skill systems and gameplay mechanics and a dark, psychological storyline with believable characters.\r\n\r\nEnderal is free and can be played by anyone owning a legal copy of TES V: Skyrim. (No DLCs are necessary.) It is developed non-commercially by SureAI, the team behind the renowned Oblivion mod \"Nehrim: At FateÂ´s Edge\" (and various other projects).",

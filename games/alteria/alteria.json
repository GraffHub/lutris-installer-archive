  "description": "Originally released in April 2002.\r\nAlteria was billed as the sequel to the Omen series of Quake mods, built on a custom engine based on the Quake I source code. It combined elements of RPG/RTS games into and FPS, and broke new ground in many ways. It's artwork and level design were some of the things we felt, looking back that could be greatly improved.\r\n\r\nDark, mysterious themes.\r\nAlteria introduced a dark, mysterious fantasy theme that revolved more around magic and sorcery than did it's predecessor. Orcs, Imps, and Demons abound in the creepy world of Alteria. All of this will return, and with the CRX engine will take on an even more realistic and visually impressive visage.\r\n\r\nOpen sourced. Ever Evolving.\r\nThe CRX engine that powers Alteria has received very signifigant upgrades in recent releases, resulting not only in stunning new visuals, but vastly increased performance as well.

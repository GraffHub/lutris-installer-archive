  "description": "It's a fan made re-implementation of Lode Runner Online: The Mad Monks' Revenge. We played Lode Runner on and off over the last 20 years but when it no longer played nice with modern OS's, we decided rather than just not play it and remember it how it was, we'd re-create it!\r\n\r\nWe've thrown in a few new features and some tweaks here and there but most importantly - same graphics, same gameplay, and even the same bugs! You can follow our progress on our dev blog.\r\n\r\nLode Runner was created by the legendary Doug E. Smith in 1983. Lode Runner Online: The Mad Monks' Revenge (developed by Presage Software) was released for Windows and Mac in 1995.",

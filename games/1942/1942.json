  "description": "It's 1942. As WWII reaches a climax in Europe, the battle in the Pacific rages relentlessly on. A devastating sneak attack on Pearl Harbor has enabled the enemy to gain a foothold that seems nearly insurmountable. After long and bloody battles--Bataan, Iwo Jima, Corregidor--the balance of power in the Pacific begins to shift. The enemy is on the run. The only obstacle to peace is the remaining enemy aircraft based in Tokyo.",

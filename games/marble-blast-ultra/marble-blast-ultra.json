  "description": "Remember the good ol' days of 2006? Marble Blast Ultra was available on the Xbox Live Arcade marketplace. During it's time on the marketplace, a lot of people really loved it, and they played it a lot. Sadly, in 2011 it was taken off of the marketplace. Now, it is 2017. A new port of Marble Blast Ultra has emerged!\r\n\r\nMarble Blast Ultra is an epic momentum based platformer where you play as a marble (duh!) and you complete many courses as fast as you can. There are many power-ups such as speed boosts and time stoppers.",

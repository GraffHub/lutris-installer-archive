  "description": "Leah considers herself lucky to have a roommate that's as pleasant as Olivia is, but it's frustrating when your roommate is also your best friend. It gets better when you and your roommate totally screw, but she seems to think nothing of it beyond friendship!\r\n\r\nLeah would like to survive her first semester at uni, but between Olivia and chronic migraines, she's not so sure she can.",

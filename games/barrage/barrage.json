  "description": "Barrage is a rather destructive action game that puts you on a shooting range with the objective to hit as many dummy targets as possible within 3 minutes. You control a gun that may either fire small or large grenades at soldiers, jeeps and tanks. Targets are fast paced and require careful aiming as it takes half a second to reload the gun. In addition, you have to keep an eye on your ammo and reload in time.",

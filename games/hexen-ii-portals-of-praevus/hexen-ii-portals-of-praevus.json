  "description": "After the fall of Eidolon, a brutal winter smothers the land - the work of the nefarious wizard, Praevus, who now schemes to harness the darkest powers of the Serpent Riders. Who will dare impede him? Be you the Necromancer, the Assassin, the Crusader, the Paladin, or the scornful Demoness - former minion of Eidolon with a lust for revenge - you must wreak havoc against the wizard and defeat his evil vision. Lest you be numbered among the dead at his wretched victory.\r\n\r\nBATTLE FOES THROUGH THE EYES OF A DEMONESS\r\nBecome the lethal femme fatale, the Demoness - a former enemy and once disciple of Eidolon - armed with all-new weapons and spells, powers, and tools of annihilation.\r\n\r\nENGAGE IN MULTIPLAYER MAYHEM\r\nGo one-on-one against a wicked cast of adversaries, including Skull Wizards, Knight Archers, Ice Imps, Snow Leopards and more.

Explore 15 ever-more-challenging levels of beautifully rendered 3-D scenes, including icy terrain and temples of deception, rife with unique puzzles and crawling with demonic new enemies.\r\n\r\nUNLEASH THE POWER OF QUAKE\r\nExperience intense first-person action with the enhanced Quake engine. Improved velocity and impact physics, plus real-to-life snowstorm effects and highly detailed environments intensify the realism, the beauty and the devastation.",

  "description": "Whistleblower starts the story that led to Outlast, and stretches past the events of the first game to show the true final chapter in the story of Mount Massive Asylum.\r\n\r\nOutlast: Whistleblower follows the story of Waylon Park, the software engineer under contract with the Murkoff Corporation who emails journalists around the world - including Miles Upshur - at the beginning of Outlast.\r\n\r\nYou'll meet Waylon a few weeks into his time at Mount Massive, during which he has been unable to even contact his wife and son thanks to strict security protocols. Having developed a deep-seated distrust of the profit-motivated scientists and doctors leading dangerous and irresponsible experiments on their patients, Waylon ends up setting events in motion that lead to the unmasking of Mount Massive's rotten core.",

  "description": "Nekofuku Shrine is a small shrine located in a corner of Akihabara. It is dedicated to 2 cats that are said to bring in good fortune and expel any misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe legend goes that 2 cats came to help the revival of the town after a huge fire burnt it down a long time ago. Although the ancient and honorable shrine has stood in a quiet side street of Akihabara for hundreds of years, its surroundings have developed, leaving it with no worshipers for many years.\r\n\r\nOne day, a very unfortunate young man came to visit the old shrine.\r\n\r\nThe 2 cat-eared girls in the appearance of shrine maidens, could not stand by and not greet their first worshipper for many years. Especially one riddled with such misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe 2 cat-eared girls start living with the young man to rid him of his misfortune, but...\r\n\r\nIt turns out that this is the start of a somewhat eventful and sexual cohabitation between the young man and the 2 cat-eared shrine maidens!",

  "description": "Emperor: Battle for Dune represents the seamless combination of cutting-edge 3D graphics and perfected real-time strategy gameplay. In your conquest for the Imperial Throne in the gripping universe of Dune, choose from three unique sides and five powerful subgroups to plot a perilous course through up to five treacherous game worlds. In both single-player and multiplayer modes, lead your forces in both large-scale planetary strategies and cunning ground-level tactics.\r\n\r\nWestwood claims the game contains a more realistic AI, in that when you start out, the computer knows nothing about land it cannot see, which is a nice change.",

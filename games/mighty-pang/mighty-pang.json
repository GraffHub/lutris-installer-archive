  "description": "Mighty! Pang is the fourth game in the superb Pang series. While the artistic design has been drastically changed, Mighty! Pang retains the same gameplay of its predecessors. The game features three modes of play: panic, tour and expert modes.\r\n\r\nTour mode is the standard mode of play featuring 57 stages. The player goes on a tour of the world, popping balloons and picking up power-ups. Each location on the tour features a number of stages which feature a new background of a famous tourist attraction. Each stage is cleared by popping all of the balloons within that stage.\r\n\r\nExpert mode is a mode for advanced players. Play is broken up into stages like in tour mode but the stages are much more difficult.\r\n\r\nPanic mode is a basic one-stage mode of play where new balloons continuously fall from the sky. The single stage is a basic one with no platforms or barriers. Some of the smallest balloons will flash and shooting these balloons will pause all of the balloons in place for a short duration of time.",

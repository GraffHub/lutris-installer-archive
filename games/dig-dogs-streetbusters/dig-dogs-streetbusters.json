  "description": "Dig-Dogs is a fun promotional game for kids that teaches basic driver's education, including safe driving, the meaning of different traffic signs, and other road rules.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is simple: just drive the car for as long as you can without violating traffic rules, avoiding other cars and roadblocks in the process. The game is in German, but it shouldn't be hard to understand -- whenever you do something wrong, a member of Dig-Dogs pops up to scold you, and make you start again right before traffic violation. Bright, cartoony graphics, intuitive driving controls, and fun gameplay make Dig-Dogs a great edutainment title for kids -- although its intended audience is too young to drive for some years yet.",

  "description": "\"Our Home.\" is a work of fiction that explores themes of escapism, self-determination, and the importance of deciding one's own path in life. What is important to you, and what do you wish to protect? What is home? Is it an idea, or a place to go?\r\n\r\nEmily Westenson is the oldest daughter in her family. Faced with mounting responsibilities and stress, a family tearing itself apart, and a sense of drive and creativity that have all but vanished from her, Emily faces each day with cynicism and exhaustion.

Does she have to go it alone?\r\n\r\nPresented by a team of about 30 collaborating visual novel creators for NaNoRenO 2017 in a month's time, \"Our Home.\" draws on challenges close to the heart of the creative soul. It explores mature subject matter, mixing wit, drama, romance, and heart.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n* A story over 70k words long. An involved and deep reading experience\r\n* Branching narratives and difficult decisions to make\r\n* 11 endings. Will you find love? Get your dream job? Make your dreams a reality?\r\n* About 1.5k lines of fully voiced dialogue\r\n* An evolving project that will be updated over time after its initial release",

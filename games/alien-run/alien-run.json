Unless all of those machines are destroyed, the planets will die and the evil plans of an unknown villain will be brought to life. The main character - a little alien named Lou decides to save the planets and stop the villain.\r\nA long way to victory lies ahead of you. Donâ€™t forget about the obstacles which will try to stop you from succeeding. Jump, run, crouch, and move between three layers to stay up!",

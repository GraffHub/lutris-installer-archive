  "description": "Disney's The Emperor's New Groove is a 3D platform game based on the Disney animation movie with the same name. Like in the movie a selfish and cruel emperor is cursed and turned into a llama. You play as this former emperor and cynical llama in his search for a cure for his curse.\r\n\r\nThe game features various kinds of levels ranging from traditional 3D platform levels, to ''rollercoaster\"-style levels with a forward scrolling camera where you have to avoid obstacles. Other levels feature more 2D platform gameplay and even sneaking segments mimicking Metal Gear Solid.\r\n\r\nThe llama can walk and jump around and kick and spit at opponents. The game and the cutscenes all contain many humorous situations and dialogues. The game comes with short scenes from the actual movie with the actual voice actors.",

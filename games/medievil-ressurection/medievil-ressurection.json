  "description": "MediEvil: Resurrection is an enhanced and altered version of MediEvil. While the overall storyline remains the same, the design of some characters and locations has been changed to have a slightly more comical edge. A few locations have been removed completely, and the layout of several others has been changed significantly. A few plot-related sections that were not present in the original release appear in this version, e.g. a sub-plot involving the Anubis Stone. Voice acting has been added. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending in this version: the protagonist reaches the Hall of Heroes even if the player did not manage to collect all the chalices.",

  "description": "Project Black Sun is an old school 2D sidescrolling game with similar game mechanics which we have seen in classic games like Super Metroid and Castlevania. You play as an ordinary guy who has an accident and he ends up in an abandoned mines. The idea is search the way out of there while learning new skills and beating bosses along the way.\r\n\r\n*Full Linux version existed but isn't available anymore (it was on Desura only).",

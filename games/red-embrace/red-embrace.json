  "description": "The graveyard shift at a dingy diner in San Francisco -- that's where MC's story begins. It's just another normal night, or at least it seems to be. \r\n\r\n...That is, until a certain mysterious customer stops by, bringing the dangerous attention of a few people with him. When it rains, it pours, and suddenly MC finds himself in the middle of a war he didn't even know existed... between vampires.\r\n\r\nHow does MC react to the dark, violent world that opens up before him? That's up to you!",

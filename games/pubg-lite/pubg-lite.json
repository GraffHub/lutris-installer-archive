  "description": "PUBG LITE is a Battle Royale game that puts up to 100 players on a remote island for a winner-takes-all showdown where strategic gameplay is as important as shooting skills. Players enter a last-man-standing battle where they try to locate weapons, vehicles, and supplies in a graphically and tactically rich battleground that eventually forces players into a shrinking play zone as they engage in a tense and spectacular fight to the death.",

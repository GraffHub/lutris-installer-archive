Both lived in the furthest part of Grynnet and managed to hide.\r\n\r\nRunella was old and did not feel the strength to face Grizelda and her henchmen.\r\n\r\nHowever, she could count on her young niece Laetitia for this.\r\n\r\nLaetitia does not have the wisdom of her aunt, but she is a fearless and willful young witch. So, she did not hesitate to help.\r\n\r\nCalled by her aunt, Laetitia flew to Grynnet.\r\n\r\nKnowing that the niece was not yet up to Grizelda, Runella consulted her old book of potions and found one that would substantially increase Laetitia's powers, so that she could defeat Grizelda.",

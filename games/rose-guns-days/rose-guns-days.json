  "description": "1944. \r\nWorld War 2 for Japan ended abruptly. A massive disaster hit the whole island and left Japan in a devastating shape. The US-China Alliance proposed an unconditional surrender from a humane standpoint and the Japanese government accepted. The war for Japan ended then.\r\n\r\nIn order to restore the country that was still in a devastating shape, the US-China Alliance stationed themselves in Japan. Japan was split into two, not in a clear north and south division, but like a complicated chess game at a municipal administration level, to prevent Japan from becoming the stage of a new war between the United States and China. The two countries tried to reform Japan quickly as if they were competing to show their power.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Japan was able to get back on their feet from the rubbles in a matter of few years. However, the towns governed by China and the United States were modified in their own unique way, and Japan no longer looked like what it used to be.\r\n\r\nBecause of the massive immigrants entering the country from two sides, the Japanese people became a minority. The people who lost their homeland had to live in a foreign land called Japan.\r\n\r\nThe homeless race, the Japanese. However, by gathering together, they continued to live, cunningly and vigorously.",

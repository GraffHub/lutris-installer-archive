Use your phone or tablet to answer simple prompts like “Something you’d be surprised to see a donkey do” or “The worst soup flavor: Cream of _____.” \r\n\r\nNo rules, no correct answers! Say whatever you want!\r\n\r\nYour answer is pitted against another player’s answer in a head-to-head clash of cleverness and comedy (or just “Which answer is least stupid?”). Other players – and even an Audience of people waiting to get in the next game – then vote for their favorite answer.\r\n\r\nQuiplash is a go-to party game that everyone can play and enjoy!",

  "description": "Mega Man: A Day in the Limelight is a freeware fangame of the older 8 bit series of Mega Man games by Riverroad. The basic premise is that Mega Man has mysteriously vanished and Dr. Wily is once again out for world conquest. Since Mega Man is unavailable, it falls to the other six Robot Masters from MM1 to save the day. Each level involves guiding one of the Robot Masters to the exit and fighting the level boss.",

  "description": "Due to a number of unfortunate incidents, Yusuke is left without a place to live when he transfers to his new school. Where will he go? Then to his surprise, he runs into his childhood friend Asumi. Misunderstanding Yusuke's situation, she escorts him back to her girls' school dorm and announces to her astonished roommates that Yusuke will be living with them! It sounds like heaven for Yusuke, but it's not: the other girls make him take care of the cleaning and cooking, and he also has to wear a girl's uniform to hide their secret. Tough luck for Yusuke, but over time he starts enjoying life with his cute roommates. What he never expected was where his ever-growing passion towards these pretty girls would take him...\r\n\r\nAn innovative and beautiful dating-sim game created by famous illustrator Deguchi Yosuke and Japanese game publisher Angel Smile, this multi-path game is organized into 26 anime-style episodes, with accurate bumpers, 'eye catch' pauses for TV commercials, and 'in the next episode' previews.",

  "description": "GRAVE CHASE is a retro-inspired 2D horror action-adventure game in which a brother & sister must survive the month of October in the deadly graveyard of a ghoulish groundskeeper. An all new game from the creator of ABOBO'S BIG ADVENTURE and BIONIC CHAINSAW POGO GORILLA!\r\n\r\nThe Groundskeeper always keeps his graveyard full. Not by having clients, but by killing all the people in town and throwing their body parts into open graves! One night, however, he murdered the parents of two kids who saw the whole awful act take place. Now, they've sworn to get revenge using science... and shovels! Together, these siblings hatched a plan to go into the graveyard, dig up body parts, and use science to turn them into an army of monsters to tear the Groundskeeper limb from limb.\r\n\r\nIt's not going to be easy, however, for the Groundskeeper patrols the graveyard constantly with his lantern, searching for trespassers whom he can relentlessly chop into pieces with his meat cleaver. As they traverse his nightmarish graveyard, the siblings will also have to use their shovels to battle hordes of the undead, skeletons, blobs, axe-wielding psychopaths, ghosts, mummies, and much more. Hey, it's a graveyard; who else would you expect to be hanging around there late at night?",

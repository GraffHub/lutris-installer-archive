Build depots and transit tubes to speed up the delivery process. Train your staff to keep them on the cutting edge. Do market research to gain in-depth knowledge on what your guests really want.\r\n\r\nMeticulously design that newest roller coaster, place the rides where you want them to be, and construct scenic structures and objects to make the park beautiful for your guests. Let your creativity shine, and when you're finished share it with the world!",

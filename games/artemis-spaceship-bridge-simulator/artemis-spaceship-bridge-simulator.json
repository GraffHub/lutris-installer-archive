  "description": "Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator lets you turn your living room into the bridge of a spaceship. You and your friends assume the jobs of Captain, Helm, Science, Communication, Engineering, and Weapon Control. Together you operate your ship and defend the sector from evil aliens.\r\n\r\nArtemis simulates a spaceship bridge by networking several computers together. One computer runs the simulation and the \"main screen\", while the others serve as workstations for the normal jobs a bridge officer might do. Artemis is a social game where several players are together in one room (\"bridge\"), and while they all work together, one player plays the Captain, a person who sits in the middle, doesnâ€™t have a workstation, and tells everyone what to do.",

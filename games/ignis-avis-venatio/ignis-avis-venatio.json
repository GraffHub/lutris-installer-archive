  "description": "Cain Blanchard is a fifteen year old boy who wants nothing more than to be left to his own devices. When a cute girl said to be a \"phoenix\" suddenly drops from the sky before him, Cain is thrust into the world of magic. He inadvertently finds himself caught in a game called Ignis Avis Venatio; a fight to the death competition between students and their familiars. The winner of the game obtains the phoenix's powers. What should he do? Who should he fight? And who exactly is this \"phoenix\" girl?\r\n\r\nA mostly linear, light hearted coming of age visual novel full of adventure and fun. Contains some cartoon violence and rough language.\r\n\r\nThe story is around 10 hours long and contains few choices.",

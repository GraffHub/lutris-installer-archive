  "description": "Grab you boxing gloves and get ready to rumble!\r\n\r\nYour job is to join KAO the kangaroo on his search for the terrifying hunter, Barnaba and his miserable servants who are causing nothing but trouble. And to top it off, they're keeping KAO's friends held hostage!\r\n\r\nStart your journey in the Forest of the Beavers and make your way past Thunder Mountain to the Ocean Lands and try to reach the forlorn Treasure Island. You'll have to succeed in numerous adventures - jump on your snowboard and race through the icey Canyon of No Return, go for first place in a breath-taking speed boat race and accompany your feathered friend \"Carlos the crazy pelican\" on his flight across the ocean, until you are finally able to catch a glimpse of Barnaba's boat floating on the horizon in the distance.",

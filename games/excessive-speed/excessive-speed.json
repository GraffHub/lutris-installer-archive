  "description": "Never liked racing by the rules? Out-speeding, out-cornering or outwitting your competitors is not your idea of having fun? Time to get down and dirty. Do it the Excessive Speed way: shoot them, freeze them, blow them into pieces! Don’t want to race against five other cars? Release your rockets into the crowd! You’re here to win, and nothing can stop you, except perhaps your opponents. It may be dirty pool, but hey, everyone has the same loaded cue stick, and if you’re not careful, your participation in the race will be solely spiritual as your car explodes into pieces on the track. And don't forget, there’s one advantage to being behind your opponents on the race course - they can be awfully easy targets!\r\n\r\nExcessive Speed will take the popular genre of 2D action racing games to the next level! High resolution graphics, support for MMX’ technology, and 4-player splitscreen multiplay combine to leave Excessive Speed's would-be competition in the dust.",

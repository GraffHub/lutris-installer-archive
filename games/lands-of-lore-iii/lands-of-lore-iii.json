  "description": "Coppert LeGré, our 16 year old hero, is a bastard child of a prominent nobleman. But even the fact that he is a nephew of the king won’t help him clear his name from the unjust charges of murdering his own kin. It’s up to him to prove his innocence, regain the trust of the people of Gladstone, and face the evil, mystical force that’s been menacing the land. It will take more than just courage to close the dimensional rifts that seem to be the source of the turmoil. Knowing that, Coppert sets off to find allies, avenge the death of his father and brothers, and save the kingdom itself!\r\n\r\nLands of Lore 3 offers diverse, RPG gameplay presented in first person perspective. It gives you a large amount of freedom, letting you choose your own path towards the game’s ultimate goal, and to divert from it whenever you like to engage in one of the many side-quests. You can join one of four guilds as a fighter, cleric, thief, or mage. Gaining expertise in the skills associated with your class is as easy as putting them into use. You’re not facing your destiny all by yourself, though. By your side you’ll find a magical familiar-- a faithful companion in your journey. With its help you will survive--and thrive--in one of the most extensive RPG game worlds ever created.\r\n\r\n - A satisfying finale to one of Westwood’s most treasured classic series.\r\n - Vast and detailed 3D world to roam freely during your many adventures.\r\n - Great variety of weapons and items to improve your character’s fighting chances, and a selection of guilds he can join to receive class-specific training.",

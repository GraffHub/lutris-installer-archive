  "description": "The Democratic Socialism Simulator lets you play as the first socialist president of the United States. Can you redistribute power and wealth while addressing the climate crisis?  \r\n\r\nEnact radical reforms, tax the rich, transform the economy, tackle the most pressing issues without alienating voters or bankrupting the government. But beware: the ruling class won't give up its power easily. Even your closest allies may turn on you.\r\n\r\n*Hundreds of choices based on existing policy proposals\r\n*Randomly generated scenarios and multiple endings\r\n*Room for different play styles, ideologies, and strategies\r\n*A cast of extremely opinionated anthropomorphic animals\r\n*Original Soundtrack by Jesse Stiles",

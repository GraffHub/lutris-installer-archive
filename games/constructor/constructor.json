Take the role of a real estate developer in a race to build up and manage resources, properties, environments, and human interaction, while trying to outperform and destroy rival development companies. Start with a few workers, foremen, repairmen, and a small sum of money. Through precise resource management you'll have to take care or your tenants' happiness and compete against your opponents. Would you like to be rich and ruthless or maybe you prefer to create your own Utopia?",

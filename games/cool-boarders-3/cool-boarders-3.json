  "description": "Gameplay mechanics and control systems of Cool Boarders 3 are significantly different from the predecessors, but the basic game structure remain similar. This time choose from over 13 different riders and 22 boards, and then hit one of the 34 courses.\r\n\r\nRace through the course as fast as possible in the boarder-cross and slalom events, or concentrate on pulling off big tricks in the halfpipe, slope style, and big air events. For those who want test all of their skills, try the tournament mode and compete in all five events. When competition gets to be too much, try to perfect all of your moves in the practice mode.\r\n\r\nCool Boarders 3 also supports 2 Player modes, and is the first in the series to support analogue control.",

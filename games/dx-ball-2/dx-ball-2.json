  "description": "DX-Ball 2 is based on Michael P. Welch's DX-Ball, in turn based on Megaball by the Mackey brothers. Gameplay uses the Breakout idea of using a bat to guide a ball around a screen smashing bricks, without letting it drop off the bottom of the screen. It adds power-up tokens, such as - multiple balls, mounted guns to shoot out bricks, a more destructive ball, and a larger bat. -Mobygames",

  "description": "This special edition of Donkey Kong Country is a competition cartridge. Nintendo manufactured only 2,500 copies. The game was originally used for Nintendo PowerFest '94, where it was the final competition between the two finalists to decide who would be crowned the 1994 Nintendo World Champion. It was later used during another competition, the Blockbuster World Video Game Championship II, where it got its name. Afterwards, the cartridges were sold exclusively to subscribers of Nintendo Power.\r\n\r\nThe game itself is largely identical to the retail cartridge, but several limitations were added to make it suitable for competitions. Most notably, a timer has been added, only allowing for five minutes of gameplay, after which the game simply freezes. Only a few select levels are playable (a total of 11, of which only 8 randomly chosen levels are available per playthrough), most of which which are not presented in normal order, and many being skipped altogether. The game starts immediately at the first level, Jungle Hijinxs, and upon exiting the level, goes immediately to the next, without showing the map. Animal Tokens in the early levels are replaced with banana bunches. In Jungle Hijinxs, Donkey Kong's Tree House and the Banana Hoard cave are inaccessible. There was also an addition: at the start of the game, instead of 5 Extra Lives, players are given 50.",

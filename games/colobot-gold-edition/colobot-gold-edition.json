  "description": "Colobot: Gold Edition is an enhanced version of an underrated programming game named Colobot. We received Colobot’s source code eleven years after its release. We endeavor to make our project multiplatform, moddable and, as in the case of EPSITEC‘s original Colobot, educational. We think this RTS game is the best strategy game of all times thanks to its programming aspects!\r\n\r\nWe plan to refine the existing game engine, improve the graphics, add new functionality to the CBOT language and create new game modes, multiplayer included. Existing game modes like programming course and challenges will also be expanded and adapted in order to create the most effective and pleasant environment for learning.",

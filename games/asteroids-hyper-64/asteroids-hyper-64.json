  "description": "Asteroids Hyper 64 is an updated version of the classic arcade blast 'em up and features full 3D environments, all new weapons and defense systems and a 2 player split-screen mode. The gameplay, however, is exactly the same. Pilot a spacecraft and destroy the on-coming asteroids, each of different sizes. Alien ships and black holes are also out there, along with ship upgrades that update your ships weapons and defense systems.",

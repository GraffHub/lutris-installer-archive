  "description": "THE STORY OF A SPARROW...\r\n\r\nThey say the city's a roost for every bird.\r\n\r\nDetective Chirpums is more than happy to disagree with that. Almost as much as he is downing a bottle of Grackle's Finest in one sitting.\r\n\r\nHe's the city's best detective. He's the city's only detective. Because someone had to.\r\n\r\nAnd he's got a new case. It's his only chance at paying rent for the month. And not unlike too many of his cases, this one comes with a dame in sheep's clothing.",

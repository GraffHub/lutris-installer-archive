  "description": "Kris, Rosa, Peter, Xavier, and Lisa are friends for life. They went through high school together and all managed to wind up in the same community college. Their lives were filled with parties, study sleepovers, and everything best friends did. After all, you develop a bond after 8 years. However, there is a dark secret that clouds this friendship; one that has haunted certain members of the group for years.\r\n\r\nThe day before their graduation, on their way to their marching practice, they are kidnapped and taken to a remote location, their long-term memories locked away and leaving them frightened. Stainless steel bracelets decorate their wrists and they find themselves in the dead center of a sterile white room with one TV on the far wall and a locked door opposite of it.\r\n\r\nThe TV comes on and you learn that a dark secret has been hidden from Kris. The only way out for Kris and his friends is for him to discover it.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot wait until the truth is revealed... What will you do, I wonder...\"\r\n\r\nWho will leave?",

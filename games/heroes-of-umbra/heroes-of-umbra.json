  "description": "Storyline:￼\r\n\r\nOnce a fabled assassin, you hunted those who jeopardized the order and balance of your home planet, Odorus. Now, after a blinding flash of light during a routine mission to stop a murderer who calls himself The Apprentice, you find yourself alone on a mysterious island with little recollection of the task at hand. Can you recall and complete your original mission and stop this mysterious killer before he reaches his target?\r\n\r\nAbout:\r\n\r\nHeroes of Umbra is a 2D side-scrolling online RPG in-progress that plays similar to side-scrolling RPGs like MapleStory and Castlevania. Whether you’re on an Android device, a desktop computer, or the OUYA console, online play is platform-agnostic. You can connect and play with your friends anywhere with Internet access, or \r\njust solo single-player if you can’t get (or don’t want to be) online.\r\n\r\nThe game is completely free-to-play and DRM-free.",

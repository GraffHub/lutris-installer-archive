  "description": "The game tasks players with creating an impenetrable base and an army to attack the bases of other players. The player must use munitions, the in-game currency, to do this, which is earned by attacking other players' bases. The multiplayer is asychronous in that players cannot defend their bases, only direct their troops in capturing other bases. The player can randomly unlock special attacks on the field and from support cards.\r\n\r\nThere is the option to spend real currency to buy in-game gold, which can unlock special soldiers much faster, as well as customize the player's army and soldiers. In battle,you lose if your transport truck is destroyed.",

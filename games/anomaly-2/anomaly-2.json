  "description": "The game is a sequel to critically acclaimed Anomaly Warzone Earth strategy, taking the RTS tower offense concept from AWE to a new level. The core elements of the original – tactical planning and the on-field Commander to support troops in combat – are spiced up by a number of important new features: ability to morph troops into war mechs, multiplayer in tower defense vs. tower offense mode, post-apocalyptic world in a single-player campaign, over million tactical combinations to build your squad and alternative endings dependent upon your approach to enemy machines in the campaign. This is the ultimate tower offense strategy!",

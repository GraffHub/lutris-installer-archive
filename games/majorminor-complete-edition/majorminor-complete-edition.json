  "description": "A wave of murder and suicide has been hitting the country, all under circumstances more than mysterious. You play as one of the \"Lucky Two\", winners of a contest who have the honor of touring with an international pop idol. But as you arrive in Tokyo for the launch of this world tour, events quickly escalate. You have no choice but to delve deeper into dangerous territory -- all in the name of uncovering the truth of these enigmatic deaths. A truth that involves the dissonant connection to another world; and the inhabitants within who seek salvation. You are The Savior -- and it is your job to deliver a brighter future to this world.",

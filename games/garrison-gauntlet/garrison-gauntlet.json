  "description": "Garrison Gauntlet is an oldschool-style action-platformer where you play through over four stages of intense challenges! A little robot that is to serve as nothing more than as one of the many robotic minions owned by the evil tyrant, Garrison, it realizes that being in such a position is no rewarding task. As the robot itself, you must stop Garrison's forces from the inside before they take over the world! \r\n\r\nPlay through the levels in any order you wish. Venture through the Sky Base, Disco Palace, and Underground Lair before finishing the job off in the treacherous Garrison Fortress! The destinations aren't easy to take on, and the enemies that lie within won't hold back.",

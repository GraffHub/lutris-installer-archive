  "description": "As if the first round of events wasn't maxed out enough as it was, Dave Mirra's back with Freestyle BMX Maximum Remix! Maximum Remix not only includes all of the original game but a whole lot more besides! More jumps, more tracks and more thrills!\r\n\r\nThere are new challenges on the original 12 levels and 8 new free-roaming environments to rideÂ¿ you'll need all the experience you can get if you're to get the better of the new Expert mode. You can also take on your friends in 10 multi-player games, with over 1300 tricks to perform, including the new 'Wall ride' ability.\r\n\r\nMirra, Nyquist, Ramsdell, McMurray, Garcia and more they're all there and ready to ride, and with a soundtrack that features the likes of Rancid, Cypress Hill and Pennywise you're not going to be able to help but take notice!",

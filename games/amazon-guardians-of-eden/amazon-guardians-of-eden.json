Treat yourself to AMAZON!\r\n\r\nDESKTOP DRAMA Journey back in time to the year 1957 on an expedition to the dark heart of the Amazon Basin. A desperate, crazed message sends you on a perilous search through a land where legends come to life, danger hides behind every corner, and incredible treasures wait to be discovered.\r\n\r\nPatterned after those campy, exciting serials such as Flash Gordon, The Lost City, and Rocketman, AMAZON brings you heart stopping drama and fast paced action!\r\n\r\nAMAZON can be played both \"Standard\" VGA, or \"Super\" VGA mode. You can toggle between either mode at any time during the game. In Super VGA mode, the screen is bordered by 16 chapter summary icons.

Never loose your place in the game!\r\n\r\nIn Super VGA mode, the Inventory Screen is always displayed showing all the items at your disposal giving you quick access in the middle of fast-paced action.\r\n\r\nMultiple windows give you a more comprehensive view of the game and each chapter sequence as well as the ability to toggle back to previous scenes for information you may have missed earlier.\r\n\r\nFrustrated with adventure games? In the past you may have found yourself stuck with either paying for a hint book or calling a toll number. Not with AMAZON! It comes with an informative Player's Guide and features a convenienet pop-up Online Help window containing over 600 hints which can be used at any point in the game.\r\n\r\nYou've got the best Hardware ...

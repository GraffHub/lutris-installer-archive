  "description": "Chromophobia is a ten second arcade game. You have two macro attacks; meleeing (which adds to your multiplier) and shooting (which adds your points). Combos are aloud. You use these attacks in intelligent succession to get as many points as possible in the ten seconds of each round. You use these points to buy one thing (only one!) a round. You buy these things to change the game with “spices” or mask your character with costumes or use new attacks with sidearms. When the round finishes, you make a small “grrrrr” at the shop menu music and send me your high score.\r\n\r\nThen you go again.",

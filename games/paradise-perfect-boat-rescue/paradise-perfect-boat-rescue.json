  "description": "What is Paradise Perfect?\r\n\r\nIt's a bite-sized game with excellent and fun boat physics. Drive from island to island rescuing people, search for items, participate in relay races and perform other missions.\r\n\r\nIt's organized into levels you can go back and play for better times. Taken together the chapters tell the story of HERO, a protege of the mysterious BOATMASTER TARO.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot planned. The game is being developed in chapters which are periodically released, sort of like a camp TV show. No promises on how long I'll run this particular show or how frequently chapters will appear-- they will be released as often or as seldom as circumstance and inspiration dictate.",

  "description": "Ahh, the post-nuclear army life where you meet strange-looking mutants and kill them. Welcome to Hell, soldier, and mind the radioactive dust. Join one of two groups battling tooth, claw, tentacle, and any other appendage for survival: the Survivors, a military community that survived in underground bunkers, and the Evolved, mutant surface dwellers who believe the fiery apocalypse was caused by angry gods who punished mankind for uncovering forbidden technological advances and for their wasteful political rule.\r\n\r\nKrush, Kill ‘n’ Destroy Xtreme is a real-time strategy game where oil becomes the primary resource you require to earn the cash to make the flash and construct buildings and train units. Upgrade your buildings with a staggering variety of options while your units gain experience and new abilities that make them more effective on the battlefield.",

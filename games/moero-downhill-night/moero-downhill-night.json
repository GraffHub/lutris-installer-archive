  "description": "My name is Daichi Shou, and I'm nothing special. I tell my folks back at home that I'm a big shot, but I'm really just working a part time job delivering soba (buckwheat noodles) for a shop on the Himeda mountain ridge - I drive the route morning and evening, live in my simple apartment and banish all thoughts of fame or glory from my mind.\r\n\r\nBut all that changed suddenly when one day on my route I got into an accident, fell unconscious and when I woke up I was in the passenger seat of a taxi driven by a beautiful girl! I didn't remember the details, but it seems I'd lost memory of what happened earlier and she thought I was a genius racing navigator...\r\n\r\nShe said her name was Michi, and she was so cute I couldn't help but go along with her case of mistaken identity. With my advice her driving skills became top notch, and attracted competition from around the country and beyond. With beautiful girls flocking to race for my attention, which one will I choose to guide to victory?!",

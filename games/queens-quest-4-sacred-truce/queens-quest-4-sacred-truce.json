  "description": "After many years of peace between the Five Kingdoms, dark clouds are gathering over the realm of humans and elves. After an attempt to assassinate the Elf King, life’s delicate balance, which was only maintained through the magic of the Sacred Truce, has come to end. Friends and neighbors are beginning to turn against each other. Suddenly the tiny village of Saddletown becomes the centre of attention for the entire kingdom – according to the elves it’s where the would-be assassin is hiding. It seems that the people of the town must answer for his crimes.\r\n\r\nThe mayor of Saddletown invites the emissary of the Peacekeepers Guild for a meeting.  The ongoing peace between humans and elves and the fate of Five Kingdoms are in his hands.",

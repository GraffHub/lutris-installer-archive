  "description": "Syndicate Wars Port is a port of the 1996 DOS game Syndicate Wars to modern operating systems. In particular, it runs on GNU, Mac OS and Windows, but it should also work on any system supported by the SDL library on the i386 architecture.\r\n\r\nThe port is not fully complete. It is possible to finish the single player campaigns, but support for networking is missing. There is also no support for joystick control.",

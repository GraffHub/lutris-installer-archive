With the arrival of a ruthless federal agent and the return of a still nascent Joker, Batman must navigate uneasy alliances while Bruce Wayne undertakes a perilous series of deceptions. Which of Batmanâ€™s new allies will you choose to trust? And how deep into the darkness will you let Bruce descend?\r\n\r\nIncludes access to all five episodes (available now!) in this all-new season from the award-winning studio, Telltale Games.",

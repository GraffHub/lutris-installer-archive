  "description": "Mushihimesama Futari is a port of the 2006 arcade \"bullet hell\" shooter of the same name, and the sequel to Mushihimesama. Controlling one of two characters, one or two players must shoot down waves of insect-themed enemies and dodge between increasingly intense pattens of deadly bullets. In addition to the upgradable standard weaponry, there are also a limited number of screen-clearing bombs that can be used in more desperate situations.",

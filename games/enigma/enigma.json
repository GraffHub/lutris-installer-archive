  "description": "Enigma is an open-source puzzle game available for several platforms. The design and gameplay is inspired by Oxyd and Rock 'n Roll.\r\n\r\nThe objective of most levels is to guide a black ball through a labyrinth and hit switches. The switch reveals its color after being hit, and as in concentration the player must find matching pairs to complete the level. The ball can be destroyed while crossing or touching certain dangerous surfaces and environments. The level is reset after spending the last ball (each level starts with two balls).\r\n\r\nThe player score is based on how fast the level was completed. The score can be uploaded to a worldwide table. Enigma is also capable of reading and playing levels from the original Oxyd files. The levels are generated with LUA scripts.",

  "description": "A spin-off from the successful Aleste series by Compile, Musha Aleste takes the same top-down shooter mechanics of it's predecessors but stages the action in a bizarre universe that merges traditional Japanese lore with sci-fi mecha action (and speed Metal).\r\n\r\nInstead of commanding a ship, you will actually step into the cockpit of a ninja-styled mecha as you fight through the many levels in the game, with several option satellites that can be configured to use different formations.",

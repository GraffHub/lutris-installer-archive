This game is challenging. True fans of the JRPG genre will love it, casual players may want to look elsewhere. Invest the time, and EARTHLOCK will reward you with a depth in gameplay that will test the most strategic of players.\r\n\r\nDiscover Your Hero Within\r\n\r\nEmbark on a journey to save the beautiful world of Umbra, a harsh planet that stopped spinning thousands of cycles ago. What started as a mission to rescue Amon’s uncle from the clutches of an ancient cult, soon spirals into an adventure that was centuries in the making. You must bring together this group of unlikely heroes to stop the ruinous past from repeating itself.\r\n\r\nThe World\r\n\r\nExplore the magical world of Umbra and discover places lost in the past to uncover the secrets of the Earthlock Artifact.\r\n\r\nThe Heroes\r\n\r\nUnite this band of heroes, all with their own journeys of self discovery and venture into the world to save the planet from the growing evil within. Mix up your strategy to beat your enemies using two different stances per character, and build your characters' battle bond to unleash powerful abilities or unique perks.\r\n\r\nThe Battles\r\n\r\nDive into turn based battles on arenas in the grand tradition to explore the depths of tactical choices needed to survive the fierce boss fights.\r\n\r\nYour Own Secret Island\r\n\r\nTake a break from adventure and escape to your own home island. Here you can harvest magical ingredients and craft weapons, helpful items and perks.\r\n\r\nGrow Stuff\r\n\r\nGather seeds to grow amazing plants both on the island and elsewhere. Many provide necessary ingredients to make your way around the world. Some, when they ripen, in stead produce living off spring, cute little kittens and other creatures that wander about for pure enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe Overworld\r\n\r\nWith plenty of stuff to do you can lose yourself in the Overworld. Scavenge for items, pick flowers, catch cute Bibis or dig up treasures to trade or take back to Plumpet Island to concoct the strangest potions and ammunitions giving you a leg up in your next battle.\r\n\r\nThe Talent Table\r\n\r\nEARTHLOCK features a unique talent board system; a refreshing take on the classic skill tree. This board gives you complete control over your player's strengths and weaknesses. You can swap talents on and off the board, allowing you to finely tune each character to your desired playing style. The talent board also features “Perk Talents” which you can craft and collect in the world, giving you special combat skills and abilities.\r\n\r\nFor the best EARTHLOCK experience, we recommend using a game controller.",

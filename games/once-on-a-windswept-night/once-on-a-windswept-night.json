  "description": "Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was a traveller...\r\n\r\nOur protagonist, a mysterious traveller, wanders the far-off land of Desservir searching for patrons to buy their wares.\r\nUpon hearing about a large annual market in the village of Castella, the traveller decides to set up a stall and try their luck.\r\nLife, however, is not so easy.\r\nAfter being double-crossed by a goblin and left in the middle of the cold, wet moors to die, the traveller almost gives up hope.\r\nThat is, until they stumble upon a mysterious church in the middle of nowhere, and meet the two nuns who attend to it.\r\nWhat are these two nuns doing on their own, and why is there such a melancholy atmosphere in the air?\r\nThe traveller has only one windswept night to uncover these mysteries and learn the truth.",

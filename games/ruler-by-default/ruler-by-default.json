  "description": "Ruler by Default is a fantasy comedy drama visual novel, played from the perspective of a 21 year old male who is inadvertently summoned to another dimension and subsequently crowned successor to an evil overlord after an unexpected twist of events.\r\n\r\nDimensional rifts don't just pop up every day, and forecasts predict you have a year before you can even think about going home, so you may as well get comfortable. As the overlord it will be up to you to carefully build relationships with those around you, and perhaps even put the moves on some cross dimensional characters.",

At the time, a clan called the Heishi has conquered most of Japan through supernatural means. These means refer to magical stones called the Amahagane which bring supernatural powers (called the Kamui) to the wearers. The hero of this saga is a young man called Yoshitsune, a samurai who also possesses an Amahagane. The game starts when young Yoshitsune is attacked by the Heishi as they are searching for other Amahagane stones. The fate of the world depends on those who controls these magical stones and at that moment, the Heishi seem invincible as they posses most Amahagane. Later in the story, the player acquire a second hero, the giant warrior monk Benkei, who also owns an Amahagane. The story then revolves around the struggles of these two unlikely heroes against the tyranny of the Heishi clan.\r\n\r\nESRB Rating: M - Mature",

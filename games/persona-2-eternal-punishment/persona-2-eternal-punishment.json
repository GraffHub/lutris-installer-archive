  "description": "Maya Amano is a young journalist who lives and works in the modern-day Japanese city Sumaru. A series of mysterious murders have been troubling the city lately. Maya has to make a report and goes to a high school where the murders have taken place, together with the fortune-teller Ulala and the detective Katsuya. When they arrive at the school, they find the principal murdered. A man with a bag on his head appears, calling himself \"The Joker\". He says Maya and her friends will never defeat him unless they call upon their Personae - their other selves who can appear as mythical figures and help them in battles. The investigation continues, but now the young people have to face real demons, and perhaps also the demons that live within their own hearts.",

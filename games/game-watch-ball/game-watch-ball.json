  "description": "Ball is a Silver Game & Watch video game released in 1980 by Nintendo. Being the company's first Game & Watch title, Ball is celebrated among the gaming community and within the company and has seen several rereleases and remakes. In Ball the user controls a character who must juggle several balls at once, making sure that none of them are accidentally dropped. This can be done by moving his arms left and right, which is controlled with the two face buttons. Both arms are moved at the same time instantaneously by pressing the left and right buttons; when one arm is moved right, the other is moved right and when one arm is moved left, the other moves left. It is this simplicity that made the Game & Watch series so memorable, iconic and lucrative.",

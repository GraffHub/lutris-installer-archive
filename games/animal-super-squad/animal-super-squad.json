  "description": "Animal Super Squad is a new and creative game where a big part of the gameplay is created and shared by the community. Players can create their own maps, upvote the best maps, and once a week, have a chance at being featured in the Weekly Spotlight. All gameplay assets used by the developers of the game are available for the players to use in the level editor, consisting of hundreds of assets and easy-to-use scripts. However, if you just want to play other people’s maps instead of creating your own, that’s perfectly fine too, we won’t judge you, everyone’s welcome here buddy.\r\n\r\nNaturally, you can play the developer-made Adventure Mode as well, which feature a smooth learning curve in the beginning, and frustratingly impossible levels in the end.",

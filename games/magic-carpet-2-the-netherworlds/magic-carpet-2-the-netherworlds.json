  "description": "Magic Carpet was one of the greatest action games of all time. Now, with Magic Carpet 2 - the stunning sequel to last year's PC Game of the Year - the action's faster, darker and a lot bloodier!\r\n\r\nThe flight experience is quicker and the graphics even more stunning. There's a host of new monsters and a vast array of devious spells. Night missions and cavern levels create even more atmosphere, and all-new mission based levels add another dimension to the gameplay but maintain the unique mix of frenzied action and strategy. All this and a mid-game save feature too!",

Outsmart the enemies, rush through the levels and collect all the bling to ensure your place on the leaderboards.\r\n\r\nIn single player, switch between Hamilton and Sasha the bird to get through more than 60 challenging levels, or play the game in offline co-op mode and control one character each! The game supports both keyboard/mouse and game pads.\r\n\r\nThe increasing difficulty will keep even the most seasoned gamers on their toes and only the most skilled players will make it to the end.\r\n\r\nWill you be one of the select few in the world to complete the infamous Toader level 100%?",

  "description": "Frog Fractions starts as a spoof of edutainment games. The player controls a frog who eats bugs to defend a set of apples. If the bugs eat the apples, an indignity meter goes up until reaching a maximum of five, at which point the game ends. If the fruit is defended long enough to allow it to ripen, it can be used to purchase upgrades. The game allegedly teaches fractions, but it does nothing of the sort, though the player's score is displayed in fractions.",

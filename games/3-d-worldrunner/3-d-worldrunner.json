A strange world terrorized by Grax, the Alien Serpentbeast, has asked you, WorldRunner, for help. Knowing you can outrun, outjump and outblast anyone or anything, you race into battle. But this is no ordinary fight. These battles will carry you to eight strange planets filled with bottomless pits, shooting stars, and poisonous aliens, all sworn to defend their Serpent King. And each new world is ruled by an Alien Serpentbeast more terrifying and more powerful than anything you've ever seen before. Are you ready, WorldRunner? They're waiting for you!",

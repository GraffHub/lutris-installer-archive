  "description": "The early 50s: Joe Dunn, owner of a boxing club, is found dead. Meanwhile, rising star Robert Yale, due to take to the ring for the most important fight of his career, has mysteriously disappeared. Sonia Dunn, Joe’s daughter, takes over the club and must deal with its financial woes. She hires private detective John Blacksad to investigate Yale’s disappearance and to find the missing man. This sinister case will take our investigator to the darkest, most dismal depths of New York. With its anthropomorphic characters and its incredible 1950s feel, BLACKSAD: Under the Skin promises all the eerily dark adventure of a detective novel, just like the eponymous comic book series. Investigations, searches for clues, fights, witness interviews: let your feline instinct guide you as you infiltrate the corrupt world of boxing.\r\n\r\n- An official and all-new story for BLACKSAD, set in the comic book series’ unique world, perfectly recreated for gamers.\r\n- An investigative narrative game with gameplay combining investigations, puzzles, quick time events (QTE) and multiple-choice dialog.\r\n- Choices that directly influence the development of the character and the story’s ending.\r\n- More than 30 characters, including new faces and old favorites, each with their own story.\r\n- An immersive world with a jazz soundtrack to rival the very best of Hollywood’s film noir.\r\n- Fans of adventure games will love its gameplay and narration while fans of the comic book series will be thrilled to rediscover the characters and graphic style of this unique world.\r\n- A dark world of anthropomorphic animals.",

  "description": "Avalon Hill's Advanced Civilization is a computer edition of the Advanced Civilization board game (the Civilization board game including the expansion to that game called Advanced Civilization). Both the board and computer game portray the same basic concept: the players manage ancient Mediterranean civilizations in an effort to move them from the early Bronze Age to beyond the Iron Age. It was published in 1995, shortly before Avalon Hill was bought out by Hasbro in 1998.[citation needed] It was released approximately at the same time that Civilization II was released and, as a result, didn't do well commercially.[citation needed] The game was also slightly hobbled in that it was developed for MS-DOS, so while it ran from Windows 95, it ran as a DOS application.",

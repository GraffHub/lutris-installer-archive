  "description": "OriginsRO is a low rates (5x/5x/5x/3x) Ragnarok Online server, with pre-Renewal mechanics and official-like gameplay. What makes us unique among private servers, other than the lack of a donation system (and related unbalanced custom items) and game-breaking custom NPCs, is our episode-based release schedule. Just like official servers did, we'll be adding features and content little by little, so that players will be able to enjoy the true origins of Ragnarok Online.\r\n\r\nTo make sure you won't get bored, we offer some fancy little features that official servers lack, such as a larger amount of hair and cloth colors as well as hairstyles, hand-picked to make sure they all fit well within the RO world, and an unique Hometown-based skin color system.\r\n\r\nWe also offer some convenience features, such as grouping all of your game accounts within your Master Account (read: forum account), so that you won't have to remember several usernames and passwords when you log in to the game, but just one (or none, if you wish to save your login data on your computer, our launcher offers that), and all of your characters will be able to access the same Master Storage to share items.",

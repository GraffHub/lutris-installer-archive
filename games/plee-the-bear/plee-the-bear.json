  "description": "Plee the Bear is a platform game in which you play an angry bear whose son has been kidnapped by god. Here is a guy hard to brave! Jump in this amazing journey to find and rescue your son. Because you want to rescue him, don't you? Or to slap him? Maybe bothâ€¦.\r\n\r\nWith three levels of the storyline and four mini-games, Plee the Bear did received very positive criticisms. The players loved the fun, the graphics and the music; the community around the free software movement appreciated the overall process and the quality of the resources, remarkable for a free game; and the indie gaming community was pleasantly surprised by the technical skills and the details of the game.",

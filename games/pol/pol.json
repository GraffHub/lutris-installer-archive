For years, he was held captive in the Science Institute and subjected to all sorts of inhumane tests and examinations.\r\nPol finally decided he's had enough. He just escaped, and he's running for freedom! But freedom won't come easy. The scientists are chasing him, laying traps and bombarding him with obstacles. If Pol stops running, the scientists will scoop him into their van and bring him right back to the facility!",

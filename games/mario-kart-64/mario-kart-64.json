Tell your friends to bring it on in the highly competitive Battle mode.\r\n\r\nAdvanced features allow you to race with your “Ghost.” The driving data from your best run appears as a transparent character on the screen. No longer must you simply race against the clock - - you can actually race against yourself!\r\n\r\n* Collect multiple power-up items!\r\n* Twenty different courses - - 4 Cups with 4 courses each and 4 special battle mode courses!\r\n* Everyone’s favorite characters are back and gorgeously rendered, including two new additions: Donkey Kong and Wario!",

  "description": "KISS Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child is a demonic world of mystery and horror, where the player must battle the hideous freaks-of-nature spawned by the conception of an unborn evil- the Nightmare Child.\r\n\r\nThe player begins as a mere mortal and progressively acquires the powers of The Elder, a supernatural being. The Elder, embodied by 4 alter egos: the Demon, the Starbearer, the Beast King, and the Celestial (based on the KISS characters), together can prevent the unraveling of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe game is an intense first person shooter that is based on the rich world created by Todd McFarlane in his best-selling KISS, Psycho Circus comic books.",

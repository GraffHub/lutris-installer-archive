Raiden III has new concepts are introduced, which includes a \"new 3D scrolling system\" that involves the camera pointing down normal to the player while the scenery moves in three dimensions: climbing, descending, and sometimes moving vertically.

In Double play mode, both players share the lives and bomb stocks, and without continues. \r\n* Various Modes - Score Attack, Boss Rush, Replay & Gallery, Option and 3 play modes (solo, dual and double). \r\n* 7 Unique Levels - The first three levels on Earth and the last four in space. Level design is based on previous Raiden games: the first three levels are particularly close to previous games, with the first based on the original Raiden; the bosses are also similar to those in the corresponding levels of Raiden II and Raiden DX. \r\n* Adjustable Display Modes - Window mode, full screen mode, adjustable zoom ratios (x0.5, x1.0, x1.5, x2.0). \r\n* Bonus Contents - 2 CD's worth of OST included with a total of 36 music!",

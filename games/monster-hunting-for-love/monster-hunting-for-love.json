  "description": "Monsters deserve to find love in the world too, right?  \r\n\r\nSit down and have a talk with a variety of monsters that are only looking to have a good time.  Play your cards right, and maybe you'll even go home with them.   Who knows what will happen after that?\r\n\r\n Spend time with 7 different characters.  Each one has their own unique quirks and personalities.  There are plenty of options to explore with multiple endings to be seen.  Look around and find them all!\r\n\r\nThe main character is veiled in mystery.  Man, woman, gay, straight, hunter, lover, all, none?  That's up to you.  These characters have no preferences either, so go in and get whoever you want!",

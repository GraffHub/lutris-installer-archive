  "description": "Café Memoria Deux is a visual novel (VN) and the sequel to Café Memoria. Like its predecessor, it is an interactive slice-of-life visual novel set in a fun restaurant environment. Again, you play as Ryne, as a customer trying out the various foods the café has to offer. The game system is the same as its predecessor (food selection, rating system, etc…). However, Café Memoria Deux offers more of a story, more food selection, more characters, improved rating system, and of course, the ability to date one of the girls.",

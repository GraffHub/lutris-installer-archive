  "description": "You carved your soul to shreds in servitude to a dark god, but false promises and betrayal were your only reward. Now you have a score to settle and it will be measured in blood! Experience the madness in one carnage-soaked package! All the gore, all the unholy war! Zombies, gargoyles, hellhounds and blood-crazed hordes of horrors await!\r\n\r\n* Includes the original Blood and addons: Plasma Pak and Cryptic Passage\r\n* Various, often crazy weapon types like a pitchfork, flare gun or a Voodoo doll\r\n* A grim atmosphere with an abundance of graphical violence, offset by dark humor and cheesy one-liners",

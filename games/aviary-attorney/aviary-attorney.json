  "description": "The year is 1848. Paris is on the brink of yet another revolution, and the prisons are overflowing with guilty and innocent alike.\r\n\r\nOne man stands for justice amid society's chaos. No. One bird...\r\n\r\nPlay the role of Monsieur Jayjay Falcon, a bird of prey with a good heart and questionable lawyering expertise. Join him and his witty apprentice, Sparrowson, as the two take on clients, interview witnesses, collect evidence, and deliver justice to the guilty.\r\n\r\nWith art by 19th century caricaturist J. J. Grandville, and music by legendary romantic-era composer Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns, this game promises to be a ~swanderful~ experience.",

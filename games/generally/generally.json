  "description": "Easy-to-play\r\nGeneRally features short races and simple controls. It is designed to be easy to pick up and difficult to master. From kids to grandparents, GeneRally fits the bill.\r\n\r\nIntelligent, fun AI\r\nTired of convoluted catch-up mechanics and AI that are either too fast or too slow? Customise your AI drivers' skill level and fight for victory.\r\n\r\nDetailed physics\r\nTyre wear, fuel usage and car damage are all simulated - and can be scaled to your preference. Your pitcrew are always on-hand for some quick repairs.\r\n\r\nController support\r\nWith full support for digital and analogue controllers, as well as multiple players on the same keyboard, it's a great local-multiplayer party game!\r\n\r\nHeavily moddable\r\nGeneRally ships with an easy-to-use Track Editor - and community tools exist to create cars and other types of modification. Tens of thousands of community creations await.\r\n\r\nLow requirements\r\nNo need for a powerful processor or a dedicated GPU. You can play almost anywhere that supports Windows XP or later (it even runs fine in a VM on Linux and OS X).",

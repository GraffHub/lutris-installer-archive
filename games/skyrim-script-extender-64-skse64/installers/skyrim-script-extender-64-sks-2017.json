  "description": "For a copy of Skyrim Special Edition installed for Steam Play only. Lauching SKSE64 from within Lutris will run the default game launcher. In order to play the game using SKSE64 the game must be run from Steam (or Lutris, which launches Steam).\r\n\r\nA few manual steps are required, the installer will guide you trough them.\r\n\r\nRemember to check the know bugs and limitations in lutris.net before using this installer",
  "notes": "KNOW BUGS/LIMITATIONS:\r\n-Launching SKSE64 from within Lutris allows the user to launch Skyrim's default launcher but starting the game from within this launcher will not load SKSE. This is the default SKSE behavior;\r\n-Manual steps are required in order for SKSE to run using Skyrim's custom proton prefix, which can only be done from within Steam. The installer will inform the needed steps;\r\n-After installation is complete Steam may run first time setup again, which will cause fAudio to be overridden and game settings to be erased;",

  "description": "Egoboo is an open source, cross-platform computer game. It's a three-dimensional dungeon crawling adventure that borrows a lot of elements from the roguelike genre. Egoboo is still under development, but it is fully playable.\r\n\r\nEgoboo could be called a lot of things; \"ARPG\", \"hack and slash\", or perhaps \"roguelike\". It is an action-based adventure game with a unique mood and style. In Egoboo, you will slay hordes of foul monsters, explore many unusual locations, and get lots of really cool loot. Your ultimate quest is to save Lord Bishop, the king of the land, from the evil Dracolich. It is a difficult task, and you will have to face unbelievable danger to accomplish your goal.\r\n\r\nInstead of just listening to us ramble on about the game, though, you should check it out yourself!

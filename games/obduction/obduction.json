  "description": "From Cyan, the indie studio that brought you Myst, comes a new sci-fi adventure.\r\n\r\nAs you walk beside the lake on a cloudy night, a curious, organic artifact falls from the starry sky and inexplicably, without asking permission, transports you across the universe. Youâ€™ve been abducted from your cozy existence and added into an alien landscape with pieces of Earth from unexpected times and places.\r\n\r\nThe strange worlds of Obduction reveal their secrets only as you explore, discover, coax, and consider their clues. As you bask in the otherworldly beauty and explore the enigmatic landscapes, remember that the choices you make will have substantial consequences. This is your story now.\r\n\r\nMake it home.",

  "description": "Liz Lidenbrock, great-great granddaughter of Otto Lidenbrock, is an outsider, who spends most of the day wiping the dust off old artifacts in a museum she runs. One stormy night, an oddly dressed stranger kidnaps her, and Liz’s life changes forever.\r\n\r\nAs the Bounty Hunter transports Liz through bizarre subterranean tunnels, a sudden earthquake provides the means for Liz’s escape! After escaping, Liz finds herself in the Underworld, a world inside our planet. As Liz explores, she meets allies who tell her that Underworld is doomed–the Gaia Heart, an ancient artifact supporting life on our planet, is dying.\r\n\r\nLiz feels a surprisingly strong inner instinct to save the Gaia Heart growing inside her. Together, with her new companions, she continues the journey only to discover that she is actually an immortal Gaian—the last of the Earth Healer Priestess bloodline, and the only living being who can stop Scartaris Umbra, the evil wizard who damaged the Heart.\r\n\r\nHer past and destiny becoming clear to her, Liz leads her team to the Temple of Gaia to defeat Scartaris Umbra in a final battle and heal the Gaia Heart.",

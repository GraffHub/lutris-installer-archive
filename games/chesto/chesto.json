  "description": "\"CHESTO - At the Checkout\" is an arcadey social commentary with tongue-in-cheek characters and tons of voxel food.\r\n\r\nYou play a supermarket cashier who works really hard to achieve just about minimum legal wage. At the same time you are contributing to the growth of a global food retail chain and its owner's astronomical wealth.\r\n\r\nEach and every shopping item you scan in-game will have an influence on the profit perfomance of the globally operating food retail chain CHESTO. It is up to you and your play-style to help CHESTO's profit skyrocket or let it go bankrupt.",

  "description": "Given what happened at his mother's jubilee Crown Prince Vitali expected he'd wake up with a hangover -- but he never expected he'd wake up dead.\r\n\r\nMurdered by an unknown partygoer and resurrected five years later, he returns to a mile-long list of neglected duties: first and foremost, finding a partner, as only married couples can take the throne and his parents are ready to abdicate. Not an easy ask for the average person, let alone a bejewelled skeleton. Then there's that killer on the loose. What's an undead royal to do?",

After finding her mother's romancing her private home tutor, she is now forced to attend this boarding school to keep the incident secret. Sad and confused, she finds herself alone and without friends. Looking for some peace from all her troubles, she she enters the school chapel. Within the holy sanctuary she encounters Naomi and Midori making love. She's immediately taken aback -- “What are they doing? Girls aren't supposed to touch each other like that!” Yet, she can't find the willpower to look away, and a warmth fills her panties as they grow increasingly wet. Before she knows what's happening, she's becomes the new plaything for the two girls as they teach her about the wonders of sex.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the world of Yukkuri Panic: Escalation, the premier 'yuri' eroge for fans of anime lesbian themes. This game includes two games in one: an erotic visual novel with multiple endings to explore, and the fun Gal's Panic arcade game where your skill is rewarded with Yuri action.",

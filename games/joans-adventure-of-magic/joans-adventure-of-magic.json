  "description": "Joan of Arc was believed to have visions from God during her lifetime. You will seek God’s guidance as you make choices in preparation for the Battle of Orléans. However, God’s signs may not always be direct and clear (divine knowledge being the way it is) as to what choice may be most beneficial to you and your troops. Think creatively and sort out exactly what God may be pointing you towards.",

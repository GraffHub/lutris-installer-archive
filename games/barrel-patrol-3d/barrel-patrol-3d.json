  "description": "This game is based loosely on the arcade classic of the late 70's called \"Ripoff\".\r\nThe idea is simply to protect your barrels from the enemy tanks.\r\nShoot them, run into them, get them to shoot each other -- it doesn't matter,\r\njust protect your barrels from them.\r\n\r\nOnce an enemy locks onto a barrel, they will try to drag it outside the game\r\nfield where it will be beamed up to their space station and presumably the world\r\nwould be a worse place for it, so don't let it happen.\r\n\r\nThe game is over when all barrels have been transported to the enemy space station.\r\n\r\nCollect power-ups to enhance your tank's weaponry.  Be careful, enemy tanks can\r\nalso power-up.  Power-up's last the duration of the tank's life and are cumulative.",

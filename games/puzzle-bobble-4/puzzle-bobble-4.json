  "description": "A peaceful day ends with a wild night when a character is awoken from a deep sleep by a visit from Cronoa, Governess of the Future. She comes to warn of a dire situation, and to task your help. The Arcana, mystical cards, have fallen into the dimensional cracks we call dreams. The energy of each card will be out of balance unless someone brave and skillful can enter the dream world and seal each card. Each card has five challenging puzzles which must be solved in order to seal the card. It won't be easy, but Cronoa - and the whole universe - are counting on you to see this difficult task through to the end! If you meet this challenge, you will be greatly rewarded. Do your best to burst the bubbles and seal the cards!",

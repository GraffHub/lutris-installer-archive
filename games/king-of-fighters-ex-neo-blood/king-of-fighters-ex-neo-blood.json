The striker character can fly in on command to assist his or her teammates. There is also an Endless Survival mode that lets you see how long you can stay vertical against an onslaught of enemies.\r\n\r\nDeveloper Marvelous Entertainment didn't skimp on the multiplayer support. King of Fighters EX: Neoblood delivers two Battle modes for two players using two GBAs, a GBA Game Link cable and two Game Paks.\r\n\r\nKing of Fighters EX: Neo Blood further establishes the Game Boy Advance as the portable home for 2D fighting games.

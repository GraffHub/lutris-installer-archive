  "description": "It's hard being the Princess of Calamity.\r\n\r\nA gifted sorceress, Juliane von Westerholz's royal duties include eating tasty snacks, lazing in bed and sometimes vaguely threatening her tutors and caretakers. Life takes a tumble, however, when her unlikely curiosity falls victim to a strange artifact, and she soon winds up somewhere unfamiliar.\r\n\r\n. . . Unfamiliar, and yet also a bit disappointing?\r\n\r\n\"I don't recognise anything from around here, but at the same time, I have this overwhelming feeling that it's really bog standard in every way. Why is that?\"\r\n\r\nSo begins the tale of a magical prodigy, in an average land far, far away.\r\n\r\nMemento of Spring is an all-ages, comedy/slice-of-life visual novel with no player choices.",

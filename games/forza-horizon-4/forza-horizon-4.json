  "description": "Forza Horizon 4 is an open world racing game and the fourth game in the arcade spin-off series of the main Forza Racing series. This edition is set in a fictitious representation of the United Kingdom. The game features hundreds of cars from numerous licensed manufacturers. Players experience the UK in all four seasons of the year using a dynamic weather system, with each season bringing its own challenge through weather, terrain and specific vehicles.\r\n\r\nNew to this version is a route creator (patched in) which allows players to create their own races. Unlike the AI-controlled Drivatars from the previous editions this version has players compete against real players in a synchronised shared world that supports up to 72 players on a single server. Optionally the game can be played in an offline mode without human racers present.",

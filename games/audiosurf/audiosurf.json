  "description": "Audiosurf is a music-adapting puzzle racer where you use your own music to create your own experience. The shape, the speed, and the mood of each ride is determined by the song you choose.\r\nYou earn points for clustering together blocks of the same color on the highway, and compete with others on the internet for the high score on your favorite songs.",

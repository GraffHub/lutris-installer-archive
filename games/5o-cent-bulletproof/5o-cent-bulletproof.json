  "description": "This game lets you step into the footsteps of 50 Cent himself. As he tries to free the kidnapped K-Dog with his crew in the streets of New York City, 50 gets shot nine times (just like his real-life counterpart) and left for dead. After getting stitched up, he sets out to find those who tried to kill him and uncovers a bigger conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe game is a 3rd-person shooter with all the typical features: You have a wide array of weapons (including akimbo shooting), there are over 25 moves to finish people off at close range, you can find money to buy health packs, armor, and other helpful items. You can grab enemies and use them as human shields and use mobile objects (like dumpsters on wheels) as cover. The game uses the havok physics engine for a more dynamic environment.\r\n\r\nIn many missions, you'll be rolling with your crew, the G-Unit: Lloyd Banks (as a locksmith), Young Buck (weapons expert), and Tony Yayo (the demolition man). They will provide back-up and perform tasks that are necessary to complete objectives.",

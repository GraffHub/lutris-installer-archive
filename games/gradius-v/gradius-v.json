  "description": "Summary\r\nWhile many of its old peers have had full 3D makeovers, Konami's longest-running shooter series continues to cling steadfastly to its 2D roots. But while the horizontal side-scrolling blasting action is as old school as it comes, the cutting edge graphics showcase the PlayStation 2's capabilities beautifully, with stunning backdrops, devastating new weapons and varied - not to mention very, very, very hard to kill - adversaries.\r\n\r\nDetails\r\n\r\nEngaging relentless alien hordes from a side-on perspective is sure to bring a nostalgic tear to the eye of older gamers, but they'd best wipe it away quickly as the Gradius gameplay is as frantic and demanding as it ever was - possibly even more so. Seven intense stages of arcade-style blasting await, each manned by one of the notoriously resilient end-of-level bosses for which the Gradius series is loved and feared in equal measures.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\nMaster five different weapon systems, each with a dozen upgradeable power-ups\r\n\r\nNew gameplay features, such as the 'Option Controls' system\r\n\r\nStunning backdrops and breathtaking special effects",

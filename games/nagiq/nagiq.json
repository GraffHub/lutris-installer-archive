  "description": "NagiQ is a family-friendly, challenging word game, perfect for brain fitness! In NagiQ, you think of English words and place them on a board, trying to connect to some special, mystic letters. You will complete a level when no unconnected mystic letter remains on the board. And thatâ€™s it for the gameplay! There are more than 100 levels grouped into 5 islands (each island introduces variations to the basic gameplay.) Hours of fun guaranteed!",

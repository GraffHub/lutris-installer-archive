  "description": "Dead or Alive Paradise is a port and remake of the 360 game Dead or Alive: Xtreme 2 for the PSP. It has the same gameplay and mainly expands with having more mini-games. It is the second game in the series for a handheld device, following the iOS game Girls of DOA BlackJack: ～Kasumi-Version～.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place on New Zack island, where the Dead or Alive girls go on holiday for 2 weeks. The player chooses a girl at the beginning of this vacation and after the two weeks have passed, you can choose to continue with the same girl or choose another one to go on holiday with. The playable girls in Dead or Alive Paradise are Ayane, Christie, Helena, Hitomi, Kasumi, Kokoro, Leifang, Lisa, Tina and as a special character Rio Rollins from the anime series Rio: Rainbow Gate.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is mainly about playing volleyball in 2-on-2 matches. Right after that, interacting with the other girls and exchanging gifts is an important factor, as it can influence how good (or bad) your volleyball partner plays. The game also offers multiple mini-games, which you can play for fun or when you are without a volleyball partner. Entirely new is the option to buy a camera and go around the island to hold photo shoots with the girls. The photos can be collected in an album which can be viewed later. You can also visit a casino during the evening, where you can gamble with the money you earned by playing volleyball matches and mini-games.",

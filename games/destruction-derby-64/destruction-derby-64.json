  "description": "Much like other Destruction Derby titles, the aim of the game is to race through to the finish, while taking out the other cars for points and not crashing out yourself.\r\n\r\nIn this addition, up to 4 players can play, with options including a straight out Derby, Capture the Flag, arena battles and much more.\r\n\r\nThere are 12 single player tracks to go through, and plenty of cars to use, including a taxi car (which you must complete the game to unlock).",

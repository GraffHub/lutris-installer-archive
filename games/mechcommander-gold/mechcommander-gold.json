Through a series of missions you must carefully plan your attacks, spend Resource Points wisely, and keep your people alive.\r\n\r\nMech Commander is a real-time strategy game that introduces eighteen different types of mechs, several types of vehicles, repair bays, artillery barrages, mine fields, forests that you can burn down, highly explosive containers, mechs that limp when their legs are damaged, missile and autocannon turrets, and other features.\r\n\r\nDuring each mission, you can capture buildings to get weapons. You can also salvage enemy mechs if they aren't too badly damaged. You are awarded Resource Points which you can use to repair mechs and buy new mechs, weapons, and Mechwarriors. Your Mechwarriors will advance in different skills (gunnery, piloting, jumping, and sensors) as they use them in battle, They can also be injured or killed. \r\n\r\n\r\nMechCommander Gold specific:\r\nMech Commander Gold includes the original Mech Commander along with the new campaign Desperate Measures and several improvements, including completely new terrain, new mechs, and multiple difficulty settings. It also includes an editor to design your own missions.\r\n\r\nMech Commander itself is an isometric real-time strategy game with the persistence of the Mechwarrior role-playing.

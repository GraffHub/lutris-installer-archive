  "description": "Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Impact ( ' Naruto Shippuden: Narutimate Impact in Japan ) is a game currently announced to the console PSP of Sony. The game will tell its story from the beginning of the series to the present day, in this game we will have a new version of Naruto never seen on PSP. The game for manga fans will be something like gold since the game will reach the depths we can say of the manga. The demo of the game announced at JAPAN EXPO is not so great but I show the power of the game over fans, not to mention that the game will feature more than 20 unpublished and playable characters in its cooperative mode, will show another factor that will be the possibility of playing so much. 1 against 1 against 1 against 100! . The game then does not promise to disappoint anyone with its History mode or any other mode featured in the game the game will indeed be a full plate for anime and manga fans.\r\n\r\nThe game will tell the story of when Naruto returns to his village to the events of the ninja war which will show fans that the game will not be that small and tiring game and will be a game with a long history of action, fight with a really true story. You can see the DEMO of the game and news posted over time.",

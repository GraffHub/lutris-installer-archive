  "description": "rRootage is an arcade style shooting game. Avoid the barrage of bullets while using your laser to destroy the enemyâ€™s battle ship.\r\n\r\nGamemodes:\r\n\r\nNormal Mode:\r\nThis is the standard game mode. Your ship slows down while your laser\r\nis being fired. The special key releases a bomb, which destroys enemy\r\nbullets. The number of bombs you have is displayed in the bottom-right\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nPSY Mode (Psyvariar-like) :\r\nWhen bullets graze your ship the graze meter, which is displayed in the\r\nbottom-right corner, increases. When the meter becomes full, your ship\r\nis temporarily invincible. The special key increases the range within\r\nwhich bullets graze your ship, but also slows your ship down.\r\n\r\nIKA Mode (Ikaruga-like):\r\nYour ship has two modes, white and black, and the enemy bullets come in\r\nwhite and black varieties. You can absorb bullets with the same colour\r\nas the mode of your ship, and they will be converted into lasers. The\r\nspecial key switches between white and black mode.\r\n\r\nGW Mode (Gigawing-like):\r\nYour ship has a bullet reflector, which you activate using the special\r\nkey. However, you can only use it while the reflector meter, shown in\r\nthe bottom right corner, displays \"OK\".",

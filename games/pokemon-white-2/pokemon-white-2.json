  "description": "Pokémon Black Version 2 and Pokémon White Version 2 are role-playing video games developed by Game Freak, published by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. The games are direct sequels to Pokémon Black and Pokémon White, and are part of the fifth generation of the Pokémon video game series. They were released in Japan in June 2012, with a worldwide release in October 2012. The games were first revealed on the February 26, 2012, episode of the Japanese television program Pokémon Smash!, followed by an international confirmation on the Pokémon official website. The games feature the legendary Pokémon identified by Junichi Masuda as Black Kyurem and White Kyurem. A \"Pokémon Grey\" game was not released due to the title clashing with the theme of opposites found in Black and White.",

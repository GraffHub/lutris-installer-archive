  "description": "In Renegade Ops four mercenaries have to stop a villain who has world domination in mind. Unfortunately he also has a big army at his disposal. To have a chance, the protagonists drive armored vehicles through relatively open maps. This game is designed for fast action without big story elements. The player spends most of the time driving to the next mission goal while killing everything in sight, accompanied with big explosions. Every soldier has their own special attack and can unlock new abilities during the course of the game; e.g. more life energy or weapon upgrades.",

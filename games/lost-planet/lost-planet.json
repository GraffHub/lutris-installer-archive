  "description": "Lost Planet: Colonies is a re-release of Lost Planet: Extreme Condition. Besides the gameplay of the original title, it also includes:\r\nThree new single-player modes\r\n10 new weapons\r\n5 additional playable characters\r\n20 multiplayer maps (most of them were already released as DLC on Xbox Marketplace)\r\n7 new multiplayer modes\r\nOne of the new single-player modes is a boss tournament in which the player just fights against every boss from the normal single player campaign in a tournament-style setting. Players advance to the next rank on a ladder after each successful battle. The second single-player mode is a high score hunt. The player chooses a level from the normal campaign and then gains points for every kill he makes. The more enemies killed in a short period of time, the higher the combo will get and the more points he earns.\r\n\r\nThe most unusual new multiplayer mode is called Akrid-hunt where for the first time the players can take over the control of an Akrid. In this mode two teams, the hunters and the Akrid fight against each other and the goal for the Akrid is to survive the round.",

  "description": "The 58th year of Shouwa, early summer\r\nIt’s June, and the summer heat has arrived earlier than it does most years.\r\nBy day there are crickets, and by night there are cicadas.\r\n\r\nWe’re in Hinamizawa, a small village in the countryside.\r\nThere are fewer than two thousand people here. But every year, there is an event.\r\n\r\nThis event is a mysterious death.\r\n(The series has run from 1979 to 1983)\r\n\r\nOn a certain day in June, someone dies, and someone else goes missing.\r\nThe series of deaths is connected to the upheaval surrounding the dam construction project.\r\nA murder case that was covered up is being reenacted.\r\nIs it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse?\r\n\r\nSomeone who was supposed to be there isn’t.\r\nSomeone who wasn’t supposed to be there is.\r\n\r\nSomeone who was alive last night is dead now.\r\nAnd someone who is here right now isn’t alive.\r\n\r\nSo, there is no way to avert tragedy. There is no choice but to give up.\r\nBut don’t give up.\r\n\r\nOnly you can stand up to this.",

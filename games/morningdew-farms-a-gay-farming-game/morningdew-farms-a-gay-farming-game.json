Now he's taken over his granddaddy's farm and can begin a wonderful new life in the village of Morningdew--a notorious Gayborhood!\r\n\r\nCody will need to work hard to earn money. Once he has enough cash he can upgrade his house and marry one of Morningdew's hot bachelors. In the meantime he'll be getting to know his neighbors, REALLY WELL, and will find the man he wants to spend the rest of his life with.\r\n\r\nPart farming game, part gay 'adults-only' visual novel, Morningdew Farms has everything for gay romance lovers and farm game enthusiasts! This hardcore adult game comes from the makers of To Trust an Incubus, so you know it will deliver the goods!\r\n\r\nIn Morningdew Farms you plant, harvest, raise chickens, sell goods, and earn money so you can advance through the romantic goals of the game. Let's face it, your run-down shack isn't a proper home to start a marriage in. Furnish the place and renovate, then you'll be in the perfect position to land a husband.\r\n\r\nWith seven bachelors, including a threesome marriage option, you'll have dozens of scenes with potential husbands. Eventually you'll pick the man you want to go exclusive with. See if you can charm him so he wants to stay with you forever!",

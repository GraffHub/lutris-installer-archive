  "description": "Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions is an action video game for the Super NES. A different Game Boy game was released with the same title in North America, with the European Game Boy version known as Daffy Duck, and the Japanese Game Boy version is known as Looney Tunes Series: Daffy Duck\r\n\r\nThe Super NES version of Daffy Duck: The Marvin Missions starts out in the outskirts of a Martian resort and progresses to the remaining 19 stages.\r\n\r\nShrinking rays and crushing platforms are commonly seen as the player tries to kill Martians that are standing in the way along with rock monsters and dragons. Lava won't instantly kill the player's character but falling into a bottomless pit will. In the end, Marvin the Martian must be destroyed in the final stage of the game.\r\n\r\nDodgers has infinite ammo for his starting gun and more guns with limited ammo can be found or bought throughout the game with the game's fictitious currency (which is depicted by the dollar sign). There are five types of guns: the regular gun, the three-shot gun, the electric gun, the bomb gun and the antimatter gun. Dodgers also has a jet pack so he can fly around to avoid danger on the ground and reach new locations, a shield to block incoming projectiles and a special attack called Nutty, which makes Duck Dodgers whirl around and destroy every enemy on the screen. However, Duck Dodgers has a tendency to bounce backwards whenever he fires a shot from any of his weapons.",

Now, Colette is a mercenary for various aspiring world dominators; the girl she saved, Becca, now an aspiring teen hero herself. The two are reunited by circumstance and, at Becca's insistence, meet up over the course of the summer to find out a few important things: Who they were, who they are, where they've been, and where they're going.",

  "description": "Two New, 32-Level DOOM II Episodes.\r\n\r\nEvilution:\r\n\r\nFar from earth, the UAC recommenced their experiments on one of the moons of Jupiter. A spaceship, mistaken for a supply vessel on radar, hovered above the base. Hideous demons poured out, blanketing the base with death. All your comrades were quickly slaughtered or zombified. This time, it's not about survival. It's about revenge.\r\n\r\nThe Plutonia Experiment:\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made by the nation's top scientists to close the seven interdimensional Gates of Hell, but one portal remains open. Alone, you must infiltrate the ravaged complex, defeat the demon Gatekeeper and seal the last Hell-hole before the undead are prepared to, once again, take over the world.",

  "description": "Welcome commander, you are now in power of one of the biggest nuclear superpowers of the world. So choose your steps carefully, it’s a small path between war and peace.\r\n\r\nFirst Strike is a fast paced real time strategy game which makes dropping the big one as easy as ABC. But be sure to take the right measures to guarantee your people’s safety.\r\n\r\nPick one of the big nuclear players – from known superpowers like the USA to an upstart hellraiser like North Korea – and plan your strategy wisely: Expand to other countries, build bombs or debuild in order to restructure your arsenal. Or use research to gain access to new nuclear technology, better recon intel, automated self-defense-sequences and many more.\r\n\r\nWhether you’re a bloodthirsty warmonger or a tree-hugging hippie – it’s time to put your cards on the table. First Strike shows you how little it takes to heat things up. You control the destiny of the precious and vulnerable rock floating through space, the rock we call mothership Earth.   So, will you be the one remaining when the whole world blows to smithereens?",

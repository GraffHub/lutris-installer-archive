  "description": "Building upon the success of the best-selling series, Blitzkrieg II offers dynamic gameplay, new strategic opportunities, and the gritty realism of WWII battles. With a completely new graphics engine, more strategic choices, and tactical objectives, players control historically inspired battles in the most dramatic and bloody conflict of the past century.\r\n\r\nDecide what missions to fight, accumulate and call in many types of reinforcements, and capture major objectives like train stations (to receive more troops) or airfields (to achieve air supremacy during the entire operation). Every battle represents a unique tactical experience as types of objectives vary from counterattack and air warfare to covert operations, seashore battles, and landing missions.\r\n\r\nThree campaigns that span the globe--command your allied, German, or Soviet troops as they battle in the heart of Europe, the deadly Pacific Island jungles, the withering desert sands of Northern Africa, or the unforgiving expanse of the Eastern Front.",

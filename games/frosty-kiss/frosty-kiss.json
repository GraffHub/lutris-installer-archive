And it needs to be celebrated!\r\n\"Frosty Kiss\" is a tiny piece of this holiday that will bring back the well-loved characters of the novel one more time, even if it lasts only for a few moments. But somewhere deep in your heart should always be a place for celebration and feelings left by a kiss in the most important night of the year.",

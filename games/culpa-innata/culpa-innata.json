  "description": "Adrianopolis, Eastern Europe, 2047 AD\r\nA World Union citizen is murdered in Russia, one of the few remaining Rogue States. This murder oddly coincides with the accidental death of a prominent professor in Adrianopolis, an important border town between the World Union and Russia. Peace Officer Phoenix Wallis is assigned to lead the investigation of the murder. Still young and inexperienced, she will soon make discoveries beyond her wildest imagination, as skilled hackers and subversive characters begin taking an inexplicable interest in Phoenix. Her investigation reveals enigmatic clues that lead her deeper and deeper into a mystery that challenges not only her case, but her very beliefs in the worldview she has sworn to protect.\r\n\r\nCulpa Innata is a story driven, point&click Adventure Game, featuring non-linear styled gameplay, optional activities and dialogue choices, branching paths, and multiple endings.",

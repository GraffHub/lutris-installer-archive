  "description": "Comedy fanatic and high school student Mairu Hibisu has decided to set up a comedy club in her school, but her nemesis and the head of the student council, Chitose Karasuyama, isn’t about to make things easy… The school rules require a minimum of 5 students to set up a new club and Mairu is 3 people short! Spring break has just started and Mairu has until the end of April to recruit the 3 new members she needs to start the club or Chitose will have the last laugh!\r\n\r\nGuide Mairu through idyllic Cherry Tree Town as she makes new friends and endeavors to persuade them to join her high school comedy club in this anime-style comic adventure game.\r\n\r\nExplore the town and level up Mairu’s repertoire of conversational topics by performing different activities such as reading books, watching TV, and visiting the art gallery, then apply those skills to persuade potential recruits to join your new club. Some skills require money to level up, so you will need to find part time jobs such as cleaning the local temple, picking up discarded bottles and making jewelry accessories.\r\n\r\nDeveloped by doujin circle 773 (“Nanami)”, Cherry Tree High Comedy Club features a host of quirky characters, catchy music, and is a must-play for fans of anime and manga and, of course, for anyone who wants to smile!",

  "description": "Physics-based space battles for 1-4 players.  Harness the power of gravity!  Fire projectiles around destructible solar systems and be the last one standing.  Two different modes, 1-4 players and endless customisable solar systems to fight in.\r\n\r\nCommand your space station in Arena mode, taking turns to shoot missiles around the gravity of stars, planets and anomalies.  Destroy your friends, bots or both.\r\n\r\nChill out in Target Practice, take your time planning the longest shots and beat your best scores in an ever-changing challenge.\r\n\r\nCollect points for hitting your foes, but master gravity and gain bonus points for the longest orbits to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat with style and finesse.  Watch where you shoot - some planets can blow up in a beautiful celebration of chaos, flinging asteroids all around.  Although you might use this to your advantage..\r\n\r\nEach time you play you'll be faced with a new and unique destructible solar system that you can customise before each game; choose the number of stars, planets and even some pesky anomalies if you're brave.",

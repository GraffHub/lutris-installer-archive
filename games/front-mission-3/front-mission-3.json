  "description": "In a near future world barely comprehensible to most, nations have formed unusual alliances and unified in previously unimaginable ways. In 2020 the United States of the New Continent (USN) is formed, combining the North and South American continents. In 2026 the same thing happens in the Asian Pacific with the formation of the Oceana Community Union (OCU), and in 2112 the Peoples Republic of Da Han Zhong is established.\r\n\r\nNew nations did not bring about a new peace however, just the development of new weapons, most notably the Wanzer (van'-ser). Due to their human-like movement and the advantage of requiring only one crewmember, these giant mech.-warriors reduced the demand for other ground-based military vehicles. This might not necessarily be a good thing.\r\n\r\nThe mystery begins with an explosion at the Yokosuka base, OCU, during a routine Wanzer delivery. It draws you into a global conspiracy in which your only chance for survival are a handful of shadowy characters and your battle machine.\r\n\r\nFront Mission 3 is a turn-based combat game that incorporates a massive 150 hours plus of strategic adventure. With upgrades and clue searches involving an in-game Internet and e-mail system, FM3 is enough to make you think you may know too much.",

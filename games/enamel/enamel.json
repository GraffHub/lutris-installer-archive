  "description": "A strange spherical object grows in our solar system with incredible speed. Robert Widmark was the commander of a space shuttle crew that was sent to examine this extraordinary phenomenon. Unfortunately, during the mission, when astronauts were far away from the Earth, a catastrophe took place. At some point, Enamel - as this unidentified object was called - flared up violently. The shock wave caused massive damage to the space shuttle.\r\n\r\nAfter making unsuccessful attempts to repair it, the crew initiated an emergency plan. Each of them went to a single emergency capsule which had been programmed to send them into hibernation during the emergency, and thanks to an independent power source, they slowly headed to the Earth... but there was nothing like before.",

  "description": "IMVU Inc., (/ˈɪmvjuː/, stylized as imvu) is an online metaverse and website. IMVU was founded in 2004 and was originally backed by venture investors Menlo Ventures, Allegis Capital, Bridgescale Partners, and Best Buy Capital. IMVU members use 3D avatars to meet new people, chat, create, and play games. IMVU had over four million active users in 2014. Current number of active players are unknown, and currently the site has the largest virtual goods catalog of more than 30 million items. The business was previously located in Mountain View, California. It was also known as one of the leading practitioners of the lean startup approach.\r\n\r\nThe company name was neither an acronym nor an initialism. IMVU co-founder Eric Ries described the accidental process by which the company acquired its meaningless name, and stated \"It's not an acronym; it doesn't stand for anything\".  \r\n\r\n-- From Wikipedia  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMVU",

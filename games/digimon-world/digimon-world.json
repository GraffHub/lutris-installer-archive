  "description": "So, there you were one day, minding your own business, when flash, bang, you're transported (who knows how?!) to the Digimon dimension, more specifically a world called File Island.\r\n\r\nYou're met by an ancient Digimon called Jimimon who fills you in on what's going on, and what it has to do with you! Something or someone has caused the Digimon to forget their responsibilities, and in some cases their own language. Digimon society is falling apart and many have fled File City. Your job is to track them all down and convince them to return to the city to rebuild their lives.\r\n\r\nDigimon World is an exciting 3D adventure that will see you traveling all over the Digimon realm with a Digimon partner. You'll have to look after and raise your new-found friend, watching, amongst other things, their happiness, discipline and life levels. Make sure they get enough sleep and food, and get to the bathroom on time, or they may get sick!",

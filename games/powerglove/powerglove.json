An explosion in the Northern polar thermal reactor has destroyed all primary and secondary energy connections and contact with the engineers and rescue robots has been lost.\r\n\r\nWithout an energy supply the death of billions is imminent! We need the five control diamonds to engage the station's backup systems. Use the shielded suit and the Powerglove to protect you against the maintenance robots.\r\n\r\nYou're our only hope!",

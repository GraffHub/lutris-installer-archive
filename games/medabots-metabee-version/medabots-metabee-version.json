Throughout the game you fight Robattles against other Medafighters using the Medabots which you have assembled and collected, sometimes facing off against the Rubberrobo Gang and other rivals in the game. Just like in the anime, at the end of the battle the Medafighter who loses must submit one of their Medaparts to the winner.",
